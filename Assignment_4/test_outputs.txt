You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the U.S.
And I always tell the people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> it as farmer, or with clothing clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know a epiphany is usually something that fell somewhere in place.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle which I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the <unk> in the middle school, in the middle school in the middle of the middle of the middle of the time in the middle of the class.
When I went to bleeding every week in the bathroom of the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by allowing me to go into the bathroom of the school room.
He made it into secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations who fight AIDS.
About three or four years ago, in the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm aware that we have never never got to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man to know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to ask you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went down to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
And we found it a place, the <unk> and the monitored and we had her family, because it was necessary to us.
It's something we knew how to do.
And so the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
And it needs truth and beauty, and I'm really happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, and love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
They put them around me around <unk> of the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> of a <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they get out of the glaciers or they break the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has their individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to <unk> and they hold up to the end, while others can't afford it more and they were <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and themselves, in large as we are seeing ourselves as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts, I am breathing his <unk> atmosphere.
As a iceberg melts as a iceberg releases freshwater rich in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way, and they will not exist in that way again.
This is not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through life cycle.
And part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you is from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's a little frequent to actually get a <unk> iceberg to be able to witness a <unk>
Here they have.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and the line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg in the average size.
<unk> from water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so we <unk> the iceberg with a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, every single one -- a baby -- a baby. Okay.
So two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception of thinking, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome is attached to the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome is attached to the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity that's going to be two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> anatomy -- to say, human bodies have considered the body fluids.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients -- or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins two people within one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, whose physical typology doesn't fit into the male and conventional female <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't get <unk> in the common form or a female.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> of the chromosome and tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that will become <unk>
And then, in life <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, your body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high testosterone levels but <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops on a typically female course.
When you <unk> the baby is a little bit of a child.
It's a young girl. He's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is going on.
After doing tests they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, like men, we have the body -- something called the glands, <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I think a <unk> woman doesn't know his <unk> structure, I believe being a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who have <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a bit complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from an 19, I was born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, sex sex with her, he had a life as a guy and had just figured out that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th century and the uterus glands were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitalia was <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component, typically a male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was the age of 19, when he started having the medical issues caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th century develop what's known as <unk> is <unk> <unk> wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that we took to several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up with a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity, <unk> <unk> wants to say to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A very simplistic idea.
And when you show us a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children born like two people inside the same body.
The greatest recent case is last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put the <unk> of the sex on the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called to wonder: "What are you going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there is no such test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't traces a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women are we who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, we have to admit that these categories -- and we thought were a stable <unk> categories that would be embedded directly with categories <unk> <unk> are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we go into science and more and more in a uncomfortable zone that we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all the events of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States of today, are the struggles at first, and at the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when people consider dead.
Our ancestors had never had to do with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of her would put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved still not to <unk>
If I stopped moving to the <unk>
But today, we can for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the dilemma of the fact that the death of someone really puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe you think that this explosion explosion could be someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I'm nervous.
You know, these categories are much more fragile than what we thought was <unk>
<unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, which I find myself every single thing that <unk> <unk> <unk> and not the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with Parents <unk>
Parents were <unk> to me, the first activists of anatomy and explain why.
What they were doing, it was a <unk> concept, and it was <unk> with another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we did is that the idea of the <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right one.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that was going to become political power by the blood of blood transmitted by the father and then the son, and so on.
Parents had rejected that idea and replacing it by a new concept -- and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the game field and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not <unk> differences -- that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it stays very clear, if you look at the story of Parents <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power being passed through a vague idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence and they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundation of the future movement of human rights.
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people who are giving up the <unk> <unk> about the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we need to start asking for why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we had to do it by anatomy.
I don't want to say that the age of five years should be allowed to have sex with sex or <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1 1980.
Henry, in the contrary, was born at the top one of September 1 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary was attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the sex -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because I have a different <unk> but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered to be considered -- if I don't tell you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered to be considered now is <unk> from the <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
I love it for his part, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry every states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved both in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of anatomy <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science will become <unk>
Where do we do?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we need to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do it.
But a lot of people are caught in a rare position.
For example, Texas at some point has been determined to marry a man -- you don't have to have chromosome and that to marry one woman has to have <unk> Y.
Now in practice they don't make tests of people's tests.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome to <unk>
If we look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I love <unk> he offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very good."
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people on the basis of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be able to engage in this for human rights to people, because I've admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that they probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and smart decisions about their sexual sexual relations that I know.
So how do you put the subject of the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
We want to actually get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States will continue to drive this current design of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian one man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless they are willing to be willing to have a change of sex, in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon who talked about a couple years ago that had made <unk> twins <unk> and then they pick up the <unk> and then they would take their <unk>
But when the phone asked the case of the operation was a very <unk> operation, he responded to me that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum.
The United States offers enormous possibilities for people to be who are without <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we have to be on your head.
Well, I want to say that I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given greater participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and it is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about studies is that women on average, is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I was interested in feminist, as a <unk> made me <unk>
<unk> what about <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to be able to get rid of rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing <unk> in the <unk>
But the more I thought about the question, the more I've been thinking about that there is something <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brains and the male that makes us more <unk> the complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very aware of finding a way to protect people through the state, it is possible that there will be more <unk> to this concept, we might have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we bring democracy beyond the <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect, think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks of where they want to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, at this point we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could easily have <unk> the world <unk> perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But we just replaced with apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments are already owners, and that in the other half is still not worth it for doing it.
You could try to increase the ability to increase in all existing buildings.
But you know the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the length of the construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a totally new place and build a completely new apartments completely new apartments always and when the rules of that place will build the construction instead of <unk>
So I proposed that governments are making new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> they would get from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and make those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened for a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the following elections <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his chief <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their <unk>
The first point was the importance of norms, as those rules that they say they can't go and find all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to the new technologies, but it needs so much of technologies to <unk> and usually they are the rules that keep us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about valuable that are the cities, much more valuable than their cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> which in some cases, they're worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk was described in very simple terms, which a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> which is going to make the rules that <unk> there and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to go to <unk> and I'd talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport is over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince you to <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is measuring by least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
All the world's <unk>
The faces of the public were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you might be able to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North Korea.
And it also involves new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated with helping to establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that they could all trust the <unk> so that they can all rely on that <unk> actually <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
I could carry a thousand square miles.
And shortly afterwards, the 19 of January, they voted on Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in the Congress to favor this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the rules in society, all the <unk>
In the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
The 17 of February went over again in another voting voting and <unk> to one.
Immediately after voting at 24 of the 21 at 24 of February, a <unk> <unk> <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in developing cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center in the city that is building in North Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years old, getting the <unk>
The other country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, it's the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators to <unk> and it would be able to operate under a external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you have already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change it immediately.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave back their family to get a job -- sometimes they're mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are kids who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to think about insist on the families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my <unk> friends asked me to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a public confession and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and more recently, to photograph and post in my blog and colorful <unk> for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is <unk> of <unk> markets and <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet people who are typically doing my money and usually my money goes to a good <unk> -- my view is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
So what am I going to find today?
It will be my size?
I love the color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothing and nothing else.
It was inside for a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I would like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know how the woman walking at TED in their underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure to use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is what I call a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look right.
You can almost always see a phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including <unk> <unk> and it's the most expensive thing that I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be wrong with humor, when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you are also <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're wearing in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember her little seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you're good at something, it's almost certain that you are.
And if you think you don't look at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, there is no look at you that you can't afford it.
So there's no excuse to anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to get everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: <unk> <unk> <unk>
And finally, <unk> <unk> a own personal style, and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried this again and again when people were approaching this week, because of what I was doing, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to home, I am going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave up certain things.
I don't need to <unk> emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy <unk> <unk> and bright <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart, and I look up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
On the left-hand side, that's the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be a totally intuitive.
So where does your brain look like?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think that for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic to make these complex ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We are going to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
A intuition that you may have developed with the age of the years is the one that says that one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and I didn't do it very well, it would always be <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar in the parking lot has taught a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have from the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with a parking lot, play with these little particles.
And when they play their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of things really weird -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point it was the physics of a few years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it's not very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit to my logic.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it should all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object is still the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been on a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just at the center.
And then we make a very good approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of a little little little bit of metal with a springboard and a springboard with a platform.
And then I made this almost like the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a swimming hole that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little help.
Let me do an analogy.
You know how hard it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people are going up to me let me do those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of inanimate objects are not only people, and it's also the light that goes through it, and the wind that goes on to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and pulled it out all the air, and then we gave it to a temperature of less than a degree of absolute absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure their motions.
We discovered that they moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, and the way that it was <unk> was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving you a soft drive, we were able to make it <unk> and you don't get to at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing is not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all of the trillions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up to the top, and at the bottom.
It's only in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
It's true.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between the metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why not you too?
I mean, it's my kind of logic that you talk about.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you write your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we got it, and we turned the lights up and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually only very quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that's here and allowed me to get it.
It took me 18 months and so.
And many of the stories and stories, they were <unk> with a very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is simply explained to just this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I didn't get <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I'm trying to actually make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better that shows the demo for then to explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've taken from their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, at the <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that really doesn't matter.
You move around, and you get <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top plane, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, you want to go at the end of the hall,
Are you going to keep forward that <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I've never come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click right here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom around in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are going on.
I love this guy, his expression.
But if you really want to do it.
So I started to play, and I found something that happened there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
And I found that the kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called a <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and you'll see that you can actually get the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, so you'll actually see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is a painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we quickly go quickly at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed you was to find detail.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how they're Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and it really does it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is "the night <unk> I think I had never seen this before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have a time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same.
You can online create your own museum, create your own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in -- I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we've just got around it.
It's about "The <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when I looked at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium do justice to your artwork and it's represented properly online.
And the big question I'm doing today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> there's a <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian, Italian all children in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that it has happened that has happened really interesting in today's careers one in the last two decades.
For some time, if you wanted to win a career, one, one would take a budget and put it up to a good pilot and a good car, a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the race.
This is what it is, in engineering, is <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What is interesting is that the real-time control systems are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming computers in the open.
And as <unk> are starting to respond in a different way and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is big.
As you can see aside that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms were going to get up and <unk>
And that's changing the whole interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
It's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo, <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end he took the hammer and he threw it up to the Moses -- it -- you can actually see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, "What?"
Well, today, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> on the idea of capturing the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup of the World.
Maybe some of you remember, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened to looking at the activity in the web.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The line line is at the top.
In the early afternoon, there are people around here and doing so-called <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> of France.
<unk> people do a call to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time I spent a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She earns Italy, yeah!
That night they were all at <unk> at the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day they were at the middle of the head of the head and the first minister then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but of things we use and consume it.
Today we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a <unk> how do you get <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the garbage through the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle recently, a little more than a year to tag what they were asking -- different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are going to be <unk>
Then we put a little chip, and one tag on the garbage -- and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> it is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we put on a day is still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and lots of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question from the mayor of the mayor of the city, and he told us that Spain and the southern Europe has a beautiful tradition of water use in public space in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology be, the new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> tubes of <unk> <unk> that open up and <unk>
It was created as a water curtain.
If you drop the pixels to be written in them, I'll show patterns, images, images, texts.
And when the curtain opened up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And <unk> a commission to design the building to the entry of the <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no windows, no windows, but when you come up to it is open to you that you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, as in this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter when the roof goes down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it's almost all the architecture goes away.
Here it is running.
It looks at people who are going on inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to be able to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way they interact had changed a little bit.
It wasn't a building that would open up to let me happen, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes in water, and you had to jump to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use that people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things so that people use.
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels and the pixels of water, and of projections over them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine you could have small helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw earlier, that moves with others in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud,
It's sort of a flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is the light, not the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears at different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then then all that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get closer and <unk> and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, it looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, of the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of ballet dancers today, the star of New York City and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left, you see the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's so <unk> 3D <unk> as a movement capture.
You can get all the movement.
You can go down the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input to <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people to get people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could do that you would have a little bit of a little bit of a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened over the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we go from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can go through the digital world, of the <unk> power of the networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to happen from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but he covered in the pixels.
You can move around inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom of the bottom, to be able to share the main moments of the Olympics of 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up as a new top of London.
You can get there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose you would tell you that, with only a lot of changes in their genes, they could improve <unk> by more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure for ourselves?
What about living with good health?
Or maybe it's those people who were always going to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What would you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How much people will do the creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me watch.
<unk> it probably had to be the number of creative creative people.
That's very good.
How many <unk>
A few more more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you the eyes of a doctor on the subject.
And the great scholar of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the <unk> Church <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology -- it makes sense except for the light of <unk>
But if they effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
refers to the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is of course, the most interest to us.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimps about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we are far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in the most basic core machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not as human insulin but it is the same <unk> chemically <unk> of the <unk>
And by talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the most gut gut that cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think of -- when Antonio <unk> is raises the <unk> think about the <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully controversial environment for those bacteria.
It's warm <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that they might want to want without effort to their part.
It really is like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some <unk> <unk> to the <unk>
But by that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest it nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or to become something different, something perhaps better adapted to <unk>
In this vast <unk> symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one single <unk> and the human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it <unk>
When I just went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms -- every cell is simply <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two stem cells.
But when the organisms come along, the things are starting to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction as the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body goes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to warn you that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death -- it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year he was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night, someone hits their door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a lovely light <unk> of clothes.
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> you search for a <unk> <unk>
"Okay, he says, George, "I choose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different aim for the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to be healthy.
I wanted to get health into the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going through the genome to the next <unk> to adapt and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are kind of like <unk> rockets that are designed to send the genetic burden on the next <unk> and then let the sea fall into the sea.
I think we all hate the feeling that Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get the immortality way through my work.
I want to do it -- not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily find longevity.
They don't necessarily pay the bigger or the stronger or the strongest or even the most smart.
Evolution deals with the better creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria bacteria, that they can survive to the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, <unk> fish in empty and yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean? When we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward, the <unk> phase, I would say that there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've got a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and so we would have a lot of it that is no longer possible to have the isolation isolation for that evolution.
A second possibility is that there is a evolution of the natural type, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> <unk> planets are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in nature.
But there is a third possibility of opportunity, intriguing and scary.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So first consider reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose to the individual and family level.
Think about that if it could be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or to reduce the risk of cancer or remove the <unk>
You wouldn't want to do those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and he sued 13 years old.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the 3,000 billion base pairs of the human genome to a cost of 20,000 and a week.
Not very much for us to actually make the human genome for <unk> and to be increasingly at the reach of all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human human insulin can make viruses that are not only going to protect us but they are going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against flu as well as a plant plant itself.
You can imagine something good about the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies, but if they could change the cells from your <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> egg and give your children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes -- reduce the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease is going to allow us to have <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could go through the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a faster muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're on conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we wanted to be able to have the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100 thousand years, and we can take it to 1,000 years, and maybe happened within the next hundred years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren from their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these choices to make a society better, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to choose our different attributes that we want to do for some of us but not the others?
We're going to build a society that's more boring and more robust and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what you could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sounds frightening.
Well, I had a only car seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So I immediately looked at it, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane on the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
It would take the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three more words have ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they died -- these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in, and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought that later on, I came up with a phrase, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to hear about it, nothing in life.
And that urgency, the way, has really changed my life.
And the second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as we took the bridge George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also give place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that we will do in things that don't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I've never had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have the reason why it will be <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break out in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I went on, I had the feeling of, "Have you dying not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell you, I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  And I scream, <unk> like a little bit.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point I understood when I connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was offered a miracle, not to die that day.
And I gave myself another gift that was the ability to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You know, you fly today, challenge you to imagine that the same thing is going on on your plane -- and please not be so -- but imagine, and how do you work?"
What are you going to do, they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would your relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents that <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many <unk> projects.
But the most great thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total paralysis of it.
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design design design and animation that obviously is a little bit of the kind of thing we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and I said, "Let's give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second one, is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're important and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Somebody saw the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they get fed with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented to the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how it was going to <unk>
I was pleased with his brother and his father in that very moment -- "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to do your art again.
Because it's kind of ridiculous that someone who has so much in your inner way that you can't afford to.
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research, which has a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer you draw on that and record negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
First of them start with the sex organs, then with the bad words, after the attacks to Bush and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving things from one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of insurance companies, and we got a machine to get it, and we could take a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "You don't know. This guy's <unk>
The other thing that we did was bring seven programmers from all the world's corners of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the children and I moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we would do something totally stupid and that when they were <unk> they would have removed the frames of the walls and in their place there would be <unk>
But for two weeks old, I went back to the front row of <unk> my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of cheap sun pellets that we bought in the front of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We take a <unk> camera, we put it up with a light light -- and now there's a device that's free -- and now it builds up, we published the code <unk> the software is low in a free.
And we created a device that doesn't have limitation at all.
There's no company that says, "No."
There is no hospital that I can say, "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And then over a planning year, two weeks of a planning, two weeks of learning sessions with all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and is looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was we had to take in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti also.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was drawing in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and would take me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In some way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserve a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to go and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong got something about us and then, in December, magazine magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up from close the <unk> is that in April this year in the <unk> of the Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show that is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that isn't possible, do it possible.
None of the thing that there is in this room was possible -- stage, the computer, the microphone, nothing was possible at a moment.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I had never done anything with <unk> technology technology, just recognized something, and I was <unk> with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do for us every day when we find something that we feel like to do, if it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time a very dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk>
It represents in <unk> and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days eating just this fun in the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous in the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been <unk> in situations in terms of horrible <unk> situations with the only goal to treat.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard about it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent a few messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about, and according to content I could get in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said this is a very good opportunity to do it.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title of progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would not have been able to read it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working, we tested the world in marketing, of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be done with me -- nothing could be so dangerous or so dangerous as I enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tries to try and try to make a film that tries to treat the <unk> of products, the marketing and the advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> of product and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that everything up at the bottom at the end, all the time; from the <unk> -- that appears before the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people went to the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is exploring all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> A <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was just more <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X brand in the title -- but we're going to make sure that we were using all the categories that we could in the film.
You may have a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe that you have <unk>
The most great car that you've driven in the largest film ever <unk> the best slaughter of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then also to show the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> Making the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The film of the film is transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the complete idea, all the shot of the beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> -- I don't know what this is going to happen, <unk> -- how much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half a half and a half <unk> I think it's going to be hard for the meeting to them, but that certainly is going to be worth convincing a couple of big marks,
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look at us as a whole bunch of players.
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> the film or being I?
JK: Both things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I need to be <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside of microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies suddenly gone.
No wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to so many people as possible, making so many people as possible as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the separate media scenario is not the idea to tell that new vehicle that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
No, there wasn't such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that came up.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily detected or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or the access of information, especially in the practical practices -- the last line is probably the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it actually something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives you <unk>  like that weird bear that's still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk> path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want to be able to have <unk> history.
We want it to be a story, but we want to do it with a story, but we want to do it <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would join me in some lie -- and that's him looking at me as a single <unk> said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, and it's my story, and it's <unk> history.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, I want to help me -- and that's just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, and I would have to take out the <unk> and go to the companies I would do with my team.
So what I started to figure out, and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to the businesses the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends that do big, big, big, giant films and others that make small, independent films like mine.
And my friends who make massive Hollywood movies say that the reason their films are so successful because of the unconscious brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "You're good for this <unk>
Are you ready? You get a little nervous.
I want you to help you for you.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there would be one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as to <unk> solid, <unk> at <unk>
That's the general.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a little <unk>
<unk> the kind of smaller films that we have, we are rather a <unk> brand <unk>
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people is the reason this is why this interest us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something intimate, cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we keep you getting more time? With better <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those that are going to make the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the <unk> of the street, the people like me, the common <unk>
They have to talk to me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: reviving the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something -- <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray and things like this.
And usually I carry gears as a <unk> or I like the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of <unk> in part of <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: 2: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk> <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be Tom, Tom, but I often get stuck in the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to find that <unk>
If they were able to do it for them, they surely could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world in which we are looking at how people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case it comes from, and they start in my family, West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like the different things.
I like the weird things -- I like the weird things.
A: Tell me about the <unk> to what do you do for that?
What is the <unk> What is the <unk> What are you here now?
Why is it important? <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more of you, which you are not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid. What kind of Russian rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. <unk> --  Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yes, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness on all of this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but you know, <unk> in your personality of <unk> brand <unk> brand -- is a <unk> brand <unk>
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox of them.
And I think that some companies are only going to focus on one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to have a lot of companies tend to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually give them to be <unk> and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and brands all those things that have gone and come up with a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS:
If someone asks you to <unk> your brand, your brand, your brand, and what would it be?
You're a <unk> attribute you are somebody who makes the blood care?
Or are you more well a <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful as being playful as the <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or are you more <unk> of <unk>
Are you <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
Are you <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are <unk> stable, familiar, safe, safe, sacred <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how we use MRI now to identify the centers of desire in the brain both for commercial marketing as a movies.
We went to St. Paulo where they've forbidden advertising into the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there is no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are making the way in schools with government problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the greatest answer or the ones that I've been most successful is those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took their donor agencies, and they said, perhaps these agencies have no better interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do to think about people, who will challenge the way we look at the world.
And how did he gone? <unk> it success?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and so -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> and press, and TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even introduced in other countries yet.
And ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies that we talk about is giving their customers to not be a part.
I've always believed that if you get risks, if you take risks, that in those risks are opportunity.
I think when you take people out of that is pushing the failure.
I think when you train your employees in loss of the risk of risk is preparing their entire company for reward <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to progress is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, they will go forward, I think we have to give it a lot to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> the fear. <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at a time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Today, more than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go along a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: I was looking at the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check out of the name of the TED matrix <unk> Foundation a check for <unk> to be applied to my care for TED in the year.
The idea behind the worm <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes are not using software software -- are a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus from Windows on a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we are ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
<unk> enters the grey box hurts <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission <unk>
It's easy, <unk>
So I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started investigating about <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
And so that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they went very strange.
<unk> <unk> like a lab in the lab that didn't like our <unk> wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then of experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is looking at an active <unk> in the gray box if it finds a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect is actually working on that place: in the gray box.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> we don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say, for example, a power plant of the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
So better than it was able to do the goal soon.
So we pulled up and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs. A little bit of a big one.
We also found that they were very happy armed with the people that obviously had all the internal information.
And they would take all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much it was <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here's a sample of this attack.
We're talking about 15 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old <unk> language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking at was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and we were trying to <unk> with the real world, with potential problems in the real world.
We need <unk> theories that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals -- we remember that it's definitely an violent <unk> must be a white <unk> and it's surely located in Iran, because it's where most infections have been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went to a effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part of the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> you certainly can <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to get the engineers to nest so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't get it off.
I started to investigate scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what do we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
So it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to start.
But yet, we found that both digital <unk> would be given to one single single goal, but from different <unk>
<unk> little is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six water <unk> manipulating it.
We are very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We need not to worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw really <unk>
There's the gray, and the <unk> and the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the values of input for example, of the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and it provides <unk> which is still running during attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these <unk> data data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act quickly.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine is happening, you have to open up tubes in a <unk>
Obviously, this cannot be a human operator, obviously.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can get bad things.
The plant can explode.
And I don't have the <unk> or the security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk> factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use the conventional technology of worms to <unk>
They were going to be able to make it as possible.
And if you made that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals are not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with great number of goals.
We need to deal with the implications, and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower here.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give them <unk> or other people who do the wheels have come up and get a walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are nothing different than something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force that also increases your speed and help, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and other kinds of things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we began to talk about the American soldier which, on average, has to take over their back a load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to get even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injury in the back, 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton -- I can give you 90 kilos for the <unk> for a lot of hours.
Her flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it goes up my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back and look back at users of the wheels, and what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people, in the wheels of wheels around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens in very often, people with damage to the spinal cord that when they start their life -- to the 20, 30 years -- <unk> against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only option.
We also talk about the population that goes up very quickly.
Her only choice, so many times -- for a brain injury or some other finalist is the wheelchair.
And this has been so over the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had a injury on the neocortical column and as a result couldn't go back to the age of 19 years now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has a few sensors here.
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the computer on board on the back.
There are also some batteries that give the motors into the <unk> and on the knees and make it progress with this soft and very natural journey.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a stranger jump in the air, skiing down the bottom <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all of it and all of it all move away from <unk>
Soon after that, a doctor came into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you'll never go to <unk>
That happened about 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last bit of hope of my self.
<unk> technology has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs down the <unk> climbing rocks and even riding <unk>
But they've never invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just from soldiers, but to the Amanda, and all of the users of the wheelchair, all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I've just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is really serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> <unk> festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know about her cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are together with chimpanzees, their very very very close relatives
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much focused on this aspect of our narratives in human evolution.
But the Bonobos show us the other side of the currency.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an Earth of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been getting over decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction will also put in danger of the <unk> survival.
The trade of hunting meat, and deforestation makes you can't fill in a stadium with the Bonobos in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughter hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it as the apes <unk> the love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to drive conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish links and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo you see roots in the face of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual,
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos just taken from the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> ball game, and I don't speak football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what she is doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Just that I think in this case to him, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is common as much in bonobos as humans.
And this video is really interesting because we <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing these unusual elements into the game -- like the <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> -- maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young female -- a young female who is playing with water <unk>
I think that as it was, sometimes we played ourselves, and we explored the limits of our inner and outside worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us up to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that the Bonobo gives us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future that we have to adapt to a more and harder world more and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
In order to adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But let's take the most of our computer capacity.
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and humans -- life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate to play, they can be the moments of the most urgent time.
And so we were primates, to accept this gift of evolution and try to play together as to <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I am not battling poverty, they were looking at fires as a captain of a fire of the volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers are giving to a highly qualified staff one has to get to the site of the fire very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability of go.
But there was still a career on the front of the other volunteers to get the captain to charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the end of night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came to the captain first to the captain and asked him to go into and would save the dog owner of the house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who walked into a building in flames to save a live live because he won me for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to go between the house.
I need to be <unk> <unk> the fire, and brings this woman a couple thousand shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got on the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the fire firefighters that was going to that height of the fire and he went into the room and went into the room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back the staircase where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog in the front door.
<unk> from the house, the treasures for the owner of house where, as they would expect, his trove was much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house owner of the house to be able to save her to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over the rest was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a voluntary firefighter witness -- I am a witness of generosity and kindness on a <unk> but also acts of grace and courage <unk>
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has their importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or they're on the <unk> of the remarkable levels of success, I'd like to remind you this:
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, it will be right now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a neighborhood park.
It's mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life but each day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So you trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big <unk> of the concrete block.
The first blocks of concrete was built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement in a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build more big things that we, as buildings or bridges or bridges to once.
So essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the <unk> came up with it.
He called her brick brick <unk>
And in a few years, the building blocks came to all the home.
It's estimated that they've made more than 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete block -- the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the donor labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> over each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to create much higher circuits and more complex, a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are going on to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of bringing the engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is they link together through magnets.
So you can't put it wrong in the wrong way.
<unk> have a color code.
The green is the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and the orange is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green one and very quickly as you can start to make major circuits.
A blue one with a green one that produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse module that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We had this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it faster or more slow down, you just run this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it is a whole collection up.
We want all interactions in the world to be able to be ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given <unk> to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light of night, or why the door of an elevator elevator is being open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design design schools.
So for example, designers without expertise in electronics start playing with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
I took a few weeks ago, and a few weeks ago, we took <unk> the designers from the design School of Rhode Island, which has no experience in engineering -- just parking lots, wood and paper, and we said, "Let's do something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is a fear of darkness.
For these engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be the scope of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for engaging with the environment.
collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can keep the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I have the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be, we asked them to work on government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and they would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
And we took some members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of getting them to the Third World we send them into the wild world <unk>
They worked with the <unk> <unk>
Their task is to show you the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
When I was a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I find a quote, but what it really looks for is that someone has to clean up when it's caught up by snow, because he knows it's not very good at driving fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for the help of this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment I was very much spent last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else that <unk> citizens with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he made a good programmer, he developed an app.
It's a nice application that you can adopt a <unk>
You hold <unk> when you <unk>
In doing so, you put a name, in this case he put it <unk>
If you don't, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a component playground.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of 21 applications -- last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads viral.
A responsible system of systems of <unk> City to see this app that I could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but the people <unk> the batteries.
And so he asks the citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when he <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that are <unk> using it.
And this has spread <unk> in organic and natural ways.
If you know a little government technology, you will know that this doesn't normally happen.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that he had done by the normal channels that would have led to at least two and side of two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the court of California that until the time over 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an application that has program that in a couple of days and <unk> in viral shape is a kind of sign of warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the government best ways of working, not as many people think that it should be.
Neither as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
That is, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to tackle the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good at the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they were building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They have not given up with government.
Do you feel a great frustration to that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics -- the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that we put together, the government is essentially a words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they don't get <unk>
Now, a lot of people have left the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics don't <unk> the government yes.
And because the government ultimately <unk> from us -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way it will be to affect change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make it <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of health care and information.
It's the place that serves calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. He started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, and put it very strong music and see if it was <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a web application, and a mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
They don't <unk> that app.
It was the work of very smart people in the Office of New York City <unk> in Boston.
One day, this really happens to get this <unk> <unk> in my cube -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I make it <unk>
The dynamics of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so you can all see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "You came to the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went back to the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it also is a great example of the government of government to collaboration for distributed medicine.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition technology of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to go and help others.
So, an citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
We connected two people.
And it could have connected with the governmental services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When one neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but you think that one is the entry of the other.
Our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have chosen a <unk> <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy in order to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government is changing our values and our own needs of our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
So underneath it is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot <unk>
But it is that <unk> what holds us to do is that we financed as something that is working on our against, that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work that we have to make the bureaucracy to be sexy.
Because that's where the true government work happens.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk> them.
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages -- pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not a political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And so for the ones that we've been dealing with government, is time that we ask ourselves what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we get to where we have to go out without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do without the government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that technology is possible with technology is possible to rethink the function of government so that it can be able to be able to spread into civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act -- we just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I, to <unk> I'm a larger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> everybody will talk about.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and do it.
So when they face the government problem doesn't really care about making your voices.
They're using your hands.
They put hands on the work to program applications that do better the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking out <unk> dumping a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not just consumers of government that we are not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of voice.
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, jails and <unk>
I've spent most of my life in community communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are telling you here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that wouldn't have another way.
I say this because I think identity is really important.
So here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we have learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the practice of right, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in all argument in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was the daughter of people who had been slaves.
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia about <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but she was also <unk>
When I was small and looked at her, she was approaching me and I gave myself a good deal.
I became so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I came back to <unk> and I was like, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I went back to it again and if I said yes, I left a peace.
I had this human quality that would always want to want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to get his time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight, nine years old, I woke up a morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at him and she said, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up in the room, I took my hand and said, "Come <unk> We are going to get them to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> who didn't do it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you do.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just I want you to tell me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is you want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
Then he said, "The second thing I want you to ask me is that you will always do the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought I was like, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to ask me is that I would never be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South Africa, I have a younger year and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14 to 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took us to my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got to do the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You guys are doing it, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> I <unk> and you are always doing the same thing that we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I went on the eyes with strength and <unk> "Oh, not to be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this spread <unk>
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this to be a <unk> I say it is the power that it has the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that actually doesn't make sense.
We can't get things that they don't think they could do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been empty during the <unk>
My uncles died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration, in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much despair, determined by these facts.
One of every three blacks between 18 and 30 years is in prison or parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, California, 50 to 60 percent of all young color are in prison or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in the race, it's also about to poverty.
In this country we have a court system that makes you much better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not a problem.
We're <unk>
It looks interesting.
We're looking at our work in our work some pretty curious things.
In my state in my state, in the way in other states, you give yourself a game for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male has lost definitely the right to vote.
And if we took it to the next 10 years, the level of loss of the loss of rights will be as high as it was before you get the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
A lot of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world as a sentence sentence from 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, without a chance to go back.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people in the death row of death.
This death penalty issue is interesting.
So in a certain sense, we've been thinking about that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death death in America is defined by mistake.
In every nine people, <unk> has identified one which is innocent and liberated from the death row of death.
A <unk> error, <unk> an innocent person nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never be able to fly planes if from every nine that <unk> one would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students in history, I talk about slavery, I talk about slavery.
I talk about terror, the age that started at the end of the reconstruction and took to World War II.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a kind of defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried to be <unk>
The terror threat was what defined their lives.
Now there are people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you say, <unk> you guys will say, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our story deal with the <unk> after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of subordination and of separation.
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our history.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
And all the time we were doing with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome racial segregation without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's good worrying to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> we don't have death death in Germany.
<unk> we will never be here."
The room stayed silent and a lady said, "There is no way that we have our story, we could never ever get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, <unk> and <unk> we started to run the people.
Let's get about this.
How do we feel that in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> to people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We could not have it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we actually don't care about these things so difficult, the positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology -- <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But then there are these realities that are <unk> by suffering, abuse, abuse, <unk>
In my mind, you need to integrate both of them.
Now, we talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that is going to be spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> that will never get to TED.
If you think about them -- in some ways, something that is within our self.
It's true that we need to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being rational, so committed to the intellectual,
By innovation, with creativity, development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great leader <unk> talking about this.
He said, "When we were in the East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in the sites of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, it must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, which allows us to be truly humans if we don't pay attention to the poverty, to <unk> inequality, by injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we're ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the big privilege being a very young lawyer from meeting <unk> <unk>
These women were getting together just to speak.
Occasionally, lady called me -- to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> and we're going to get back to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
And I said, "Be lady. I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
So I was going to just go and simply <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks led to me and said, "Now, <unk> me that is that idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for the children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We're trying to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech, and I was looking at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> put my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find a way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because ultimately humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I have come to understand and to believe that every one of us is higher at the worst of us that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, is not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belongs to you, it's not a <unk>
Even, if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
So it isn't.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I believe that although it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> it will not judge us by our technology, for our design or our intellectual and rational capacity.
At the end of a society, the character of a society, not because they treat the rich and powerful people, but in the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make too much force.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison and I see my clients for 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were going to become like adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge become a person who is not it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One very late evening, I was awake at God, if the judge can become something that you don't are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a 14 year-old <unk> a tiny, black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my youngest black client is treated as a very privileged white white man of a <unk>
In <unk> I put that there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there is no ethics, but a lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it, he had sent it to the court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And then finally, <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this stupid.
I got into the car and I really felt <unk> <unk>
I went on to the court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got off the car. He walks to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
So I came up and I got <unk>
And I would tell you in the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That profoundly connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
I saw the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> I said, "You know, I start argue.
People started to. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
The cops got the prosecutors to see the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and we were all mad because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I looked at the <unk> that was going to be <unk>
I would look at the window and you would hear all that <unk>
They were walking over here and for there.
Finally, this old black man, with the face of concern, went into the room and sat behind me almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant showed up, because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> on the old black boy.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood up and looked at the <unk> he looked at me and said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young woman who would keep his view in the target with <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds up towards justice.
That we cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an evident in the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that isn't a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there's going to be a <unk> this spring in which an effort is going to be able to make the funds that are spent today in terms of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row in the next five years, billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get anything.
Here's an opportunity to change.
This <unk> is going to come up to come up with these funds to make the law <unk> to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say that you think this is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's for the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric from the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to <unk> <unk> to steal a bicycle, for small crime crimes against property, instead of making those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that you have to change.
CA: <unk> you've got to be excited about here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
Voice 2: The threats by Bin Laden.

Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media media would prefer to <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of the day our senses are getting more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters more than to survive, the first stop on all of those data is an old piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the <unk>
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
And so that's why a <unk> of stories would look at the negative.
That old adage of the <unk> "If there are blood blood, it's very true.
And because all of the digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of a week, 24 hours a day, not surprising that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong in worse.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe instead, what happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, the climate change, the <unk> of the species, the scarcity of water and <unk> without doubt it.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long time, we just left with them.
<unk> then happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> average per capita income has been <unk> all over the world.
Child mortality has been reduced 10 times.
Furthermore, the cost of food, from electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy has 25 percent to more than 80 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to get more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, a lot of the people who live under the line of poverty have electricity, toilets, <unk> TV, mobile air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the planet, would never have been dreamed of such <unk>
It was a lot of this technology -- and then it brings its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad days, in the war and peace, in the recession, of depression and <unk>
It's the end of rapid computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> on a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
The computation in the cloud, which my friends are called infinite computing, and the ability to democratize care and distribute personalized production and distribute personalized production around the planet, synthetic biology, -- cells, vaccines and food, digital, digital, <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" of Watson, <unk>
It was <unk>
I was looking at the newspapers the best headline I <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, that is available for all the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And each year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> is to create a life of how possible.
It's about taking that that is <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum metal was the most valuable metal on the planet, was worth more than the gold and the <unk>
For that reason the tip of Washington to Washington is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a complete metal <unk>
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came out and made of the aluminum thing that we used as if it was <unk>
It will take this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that are <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They go to the Earth 16 percent of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about scarcity, it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, the solar electricity will cost six cents a <unk> for the time compared to 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
So let's talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager spacecraft on the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a famous photo, how do you get <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent of it is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, he gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any source -- saltwater, <unk> <unk> by less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just assumed that I'm going to make an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which we will be, Coca-Cola is to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a bottom-up innovation for this technology that today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications communications than the Reagan president, 25 years ago.
And by having a smartphone with Google, you have access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
Now, better than that, the things that you and I have paid for dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video images, images of books and music, or diagnostic technology is now <unk> and lose value value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes when it comes to health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation -- something called the X X <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world to bring these technologies into a mobile device where you speak, and given that it has <unk> can be extracted blood from finger.
To win it has to do better diagnostics than a master team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health care workers.
When this device would be <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that will not be <unk> to call the health <unk> and first of all, prevent the pandemic happen.
But this is the largest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We've just got the <unk> of the seven billion billion.
By the way, the best protection is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we spend two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before <unk> and the global conversation.
What do these people?
What <unk> <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And more health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Academy Khan and because of the use of 3D impressions and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion more members of humanity, healthy healthy and <unk>
How about a voices never before <unk>
What if we give them to the genes wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What are these three billion <unk>
And if you are contributions that we can't afford to.
One thing that I learned with the X Prize, is that small equipment, guided by their passion with a goal of course, can do things that are going to do things that were before they could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that probably some of you already know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this college teachers in each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it's shown that today the machinery of recognition of human patterns is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me enormous confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion different minds that are going to be involved in the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a couple of extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you give them three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story many times about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> are still saying they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: <unk>
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> from about 20 kilometers, the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was more than the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the number of fish had fallen over in half.
<unk> at the top five inches.
It will be a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> at the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, <unk> started in the <unk> Europe made a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was imposing the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite nice -- he called the <unk> four.
I went out to fishing in it, and we did studies in South American Sea <unk> and, above all, in the Sargasso Sea.
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And most of the fish are blobs of tiny blobs of <unk> the remains of coral reef fish.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing begins.
The bottom part of being a solid coral coral in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains that they collect the fishermen every time you go to an area where they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
We don't remember.
They put up the point of starting -- the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the advantage of changes.
And at the end of the end, they keep a few <unk> remains.
And that, in great measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is affecting people when societies kill their animals without knowing what they've done to about about about generations of it.
Because obviously, an animal that is very prevalent before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a peak of big fish.
They become little frequent because the <unk>
We have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as a captain such and such looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used, or, usually they don't use the <unk> scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
So the huge role that can be able to fulfill a protected marine area.
Because with the marine marine areas, we really really recreated the past.
And so we would see the past that people can't think about because the starting point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected protected area and can benefit from the vision that allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the West -- for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago there were gray whales in the Bay Bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and the <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why are we <unk>
Because it raises something that in some sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is Cameron, to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why we're going to see what videos are made, and what relevance does that matter?
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed something very, very difficult.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or from our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can get a famous Internet on a <unk>
You get over 48 hours of video on YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage does viral and get a lot of visits and make a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views of the popularity of the summer.
<unk> was not proposed to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double bow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
And there was a lot of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this <unk> that I would get to the <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> are present to us with new and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday Friday. You have to start on a Friday.   Everybody wants to get the weekend on a week --  --  -- <unk> Friday. <unk> on the Friday.  KA: I wouldn't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> <unk> Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday morning.
Well, it took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science Foundation was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends embrace a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this great <unk> then start talking about that and doing things.
And now there's 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
That's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that that's weird, you know that there is a three version of three hours that has seen four million times.
All the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk>
There was <unk>
Somebody made an version of the old version.
And then it came up.
Suddenly, we came up with a whole community of <unk> which made this happen from being a dumb joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
What script could I have been written by that <unk>
In a world where two days of video was coming up with a minute, only the only unexpected and unexpected can make it <unk> so these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this big video of a guy who protest <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't get interested too much.
Casey <unk> I was blown away by not circular by <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you reasonably properly by <unk>
KA: Because of the surprise of the surprise and its humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth for all the new thing we do in a creative way.
And all this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities of participation, the creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, features of a new kind of culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
I don't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the current media -- but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the single hope of a unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long friends, friends, now I will do it.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother was never allowed to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I would do it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at the dawn of <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage, two little girls.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task for her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And then after a <unk> of four years that defies fiction, a boat goes into the sea dressed from <unk> ship.
All of the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the supply and the rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother had a <unk> <unk>
If we asked ourselves first, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
So my first memories are about that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the horizon and vast and vacuum.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil platform in the east coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to finish the journey was too much to it; and the first apple that I tasted given by the men in the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> and the population is made of immigrants from immigrants away.
Unlike the middle suburbs of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the world -- the existence I was born in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the shops were the rest of the world.
And the English fragments of English <unk> among people who had one thing in common: were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car line, working on six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk> from <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and they raised an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, you wouldn't mind what it should be <unk> that usually was <unk> <unk>
Two pairs of middle of the school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform, to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back again.
At home, where?
Something in me was <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we would tell us about our day and <unk> the motions of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until its nightmares started to be able to make it <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And women came up with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition, angry and <unk> boys and <unk>
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel.
In one, it was the classical Asian student, left with what <unk> of myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in lives -- <unk> tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many people received help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer I chose the Australian young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to another, but the edges of the <unk>
So we had a resident a <unk> resident -- was now so <unk> refugee and activist invited invited to talk to the sites that I had never heard of, and in houses that she'd never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she got to the ship.
There was no choice.
He said, "What are you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about it -- it was more <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they were living in the border of possible.
And although I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a career race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown, a newly new <unk> in the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that is going to be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
And I gave enough steps outside of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that they didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, a <unk> optimism of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people for whom <unk> cannot be <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was making a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
<unk> up to entry at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant, and we opened up step.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single trip.
My <unk> again.
Three months later there were <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised by alone.
The 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of their husband, caused a <unk> to the <unk> and he took the cause of it, and a lot more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't do it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in a <unk> hotel when she died, <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell the stories and made sure that we were still with it.
The night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is her hand hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
They don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life has been built, we can now see that men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would be very easily.
I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might want to want that to know?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave <unk> in every wave, the constant rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give you and see a safe, you would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of so is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer, <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were a conversation about how nothing changed from the age of old Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> at a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
In that time when I was teaching, the great prince of Indian British warrior had <unk> he pulled out a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that struck me a lot.
I felt a little bit more than <unk>
I had this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't help my friends.
It seemed to me that the technology had to allow magic, not to <unk>
As a little girl my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of technology was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones and the cameras prevent them to <unk>
It was our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came up to this technological world to see how we use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
I got books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are.
<unk> the text with the image, the animation and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do we do is that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each other.
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I go back a character from the book.
In several times I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes led to me.
My little girl inside of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, those ideas that <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar was always exciting to me.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And they actually light up your way in what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a lot of a <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I move to this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In every fantasy of fantasy there has always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect for me is to create Indian content and the contemporary thing.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of fairies and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that it involves current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, they don't do it.
So to regain this childhood ritual we have to go out and in one chapter, and we would take a picture of a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of photos that you can then put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variations of connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we had a interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through <unk> you see a group of <unk> that appear on the inner plants inside the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves there.
And you have to make the sound of wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to go into a world where forces forces themselves with technology and magic and technology come to each other.
It would make the power of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and the magic world, and the child love that we sat through by a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University University was <unk> to a director of the listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone or perhaps not all of us, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail since we stop listening.
This is my scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a doorknob and it has <unk>
All the morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put a challenge to 95 <unk>
But it is so simple that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my <unk> doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time that I need to be <unk> or some urgency of that style, but to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect myself to my Wi-Fi scale and before coming up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the week next to be available now.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or a device.
And people who are <unk> from their homes, to take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, return to control and being captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges that we face as the firing of the costs of attention to <unk> the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but it also through <unk>
And one of the things we did, I would like to share it with you with a video video.
We all have checks at <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> <unk>
Where are you all <unk>
And of course, we can find food chains of fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked it, but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please see <unk> where, when it's open, because they sometimes open up in a little office of office and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use their iPhone, and the next few weeks of Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> to find the nearest <unk> what can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we would call them a global level.
We're <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so we help us find work and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> all over the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I'd also like to invite companies all over the world that could help us validate these <unk>
You could be <unk> or people from <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in its place.
Please <unk> in this and not just improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
I mixed with my previous passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you <unk>
For me, photography was more than to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful time but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way as photography.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to capture an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem real.
They're the details or the <unk>
Put the light?
What is it that creates <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end of this is our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it in a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is a <unk>
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way, you can create something that still seems like <unk> as if it was.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So, <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really trying to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem realistic -- I think they're those in which we don't even have the things that surround us in our daily lives.
But when you combine pictures it's very important to <unk> because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are <unk> they must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning, and the end of the different images with a perfect living.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is completely comprised of photographs of different places.
And I think I think it's easier to create a place that find it <unk> because you don't need to put the ideas on the head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to be able to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone <unk>
And yes, I even did the <unk> house at the top of the island so that it seems more <unk>
So to make a realistic result of a realistic result I think it takes planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and at the very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide on technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as a lot of other we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, each step here represents a order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's something weird here.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights up.
It gets more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do you make technological curves on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve where you say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to give you the diagram would see something ridiculous.
That would be something like this.
That doesn't say a lot.
But if you were to ask for example, some other technology, like transport, in a <unk> curve would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> shift.
If the technology of transportation is as fast as the <unk> last morning we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of the technological development of economic growth that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to argue is -- looking at these <unk> curves we see that they're not waiting forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
It takes one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we are in a transition from what the world is used to a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask me, is, what is that new way that <unk> the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're involved in it.
I remember a child in the future 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think that's because we feel something is going on.
That happens a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different than extrapolate from what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things over the long term.
The scale of time in which I'd like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back a couple of 2.5 million years ago when the Earth was a great <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that are <unk> around them.
If we look at the way those chemicals organized we give us an idea of how things happened to us.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that moment, he had been floating on some <unk> of oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those blobs of oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them to bring out of the outside of the outside of the outside and the drops grew up there.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- these oil <unk>
But those blobs were not alive, in the current sense, because each of them had a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you were <unk> they would be a distribution of the chemicals that are <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow it would be better to be better at the time to incorporate the chemical <unk> more <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>
They usually lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, chemistry, very simple, but things became interesting when these blobs learned the trick of abstraction.
So somehow we don't understand very well these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learn to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution with no sense, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were to be able to do with it.
The amazing thing is that that kind of script seems to have remained stable since evolved two two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same kind of writing.
In fact, every living thing is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide to the airport <unk>
But <unk> I took this <unk> the code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and it would take it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years ago.
But then another big step happened in which things became very different -- and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming so cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
That way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some of the bacteria found the way we avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that they could get communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and set up a <unk>
In that way, or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community were <unk> more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities were approaching so much that, in fact, came together and decided to write the whole recipe of the community board in a DNA chain.
The next stage was interesting to life took another billion years.
And in that stage, we have communities <unk> communities from many different kinds of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that are no longer acting alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart of the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels that cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened in these communities.
These began to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't do more than process information in community.
It's the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those microbial cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the so-called responsible structures to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time period of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learn how to eat some of the fruit because I knew bad and got sick the last time he swallowed it.
That could happen during the life of a organism given that before they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of the individuals that ate that fruit collapse.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution might now happen to happen to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea in your head.
I'm here sitting here with a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea: <unk> and <unk> in their heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
Now we spent similar periods of different periods to organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> the computer tape -- the <unk> the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to drive that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in time.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where some evolution produced with the <unk> program to our eyes.
And now we have accelerated time scales.
The first stages of the story that I told you about took a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The following, the language etc., they took less than a million years.
And beyond, like electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates their own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to write a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor on that machine <unk>
There are thousands of millions.
Instead of that, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that you couldn't do, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes using methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using is the evolution itself.
So we put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the past.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions of instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those who are more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to <unk> numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, could we find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, "You could take 10 percent of those random sequences that they better did the <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> to the rest.
And now we can see the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog <unk> to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that children are going to make the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please, repeat the <unk>
Let's get back again.
Some mutations would be.
And it tries to try and try and forth with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in a little bit of complicated, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that orders a perfect perfect way.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs that I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to discuss them to see how they work.
It's dark black, strangers.
But they meet the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they achieve because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
I was going to go on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he gets a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to provide a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than the normal engineering does.
However, we don't understand the whole choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much more fast, and so they can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at a point of analog to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part of us to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of what's going to come.
But now comes lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give up part of my false <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that <unk> bat was three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game of game without being <unk> and anyone who's going to be <unk> to the first base of the first base -- not to be <unk> and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that is someone who was 10 of the <unk> hit four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the Women's League <unk> in a regular season.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon that has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place, and a dear self has two arteries <unk> <unk> and your family doctor derived from a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting a lot better this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask:
What do you think is the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or a heart surgeon or a <unk> <unk>
<unk>
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, or a <unk>
What we do, however, is sending them into the world, and I would include the <unk> of being perfect.
I never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medicine.
I was a college <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> to a blood test.
You know.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if you were able to do everything, then it would know everything, or more possible, close to everything, because this is how I get rid of mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought to the emergency service to the emergency service where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room requested to go to a cardiologist was going to be able to attend that patient.
He reporting to the chief of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I heard it, I heard a sound <unk> in both sides, which gives me a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, these are <unk> of blood, and that's why there's a difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I would tell her.
I gave it <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave him a <unk> of water, so that he could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And it was when I made the first <unk> I sent him to his house.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get the phone and I did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, he would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident who would live constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When he sent her home, I didn't take attention to a voice on my inside which said, <unk> isn't a good idea.
In fact, I was so safe that I was asked to ask the nurse to get to the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he was signed up high and the ambulance together with the ambulance and they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I went to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was my car to go home. At that moment I did something I don't do normally, at that time.
It went through the emergency service service.
And there was another nurse, not that <unk> of Mrs. <unk> before, but another one. He told me three words, those three words that most emergency medical doctors.
Other specialists fear them as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are <unk> You remember this.
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
"Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and went back to the verge of death.
After an hour of having arrived at the house, after I gave him the high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance and brought them to the emergency room with a blood pressure of 50 millimeters -- which means a shock green.
I barely breathe and she was blue.
The emergency staff will make all their resources.
They gave them medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and I was hoping against all hope that was <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obvious that they never <unk>
He had a <unk> brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was going to be done by what was happening.
And on the ninth day, they let him go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say that they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks following, I was fascinated by that, and I experienced the shame that there is in our medical culture and I felt just <unk> <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get it with your colleagues.
One makes peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The shame <unk> that I talk about is that makes us feel very wrong with it.
It's the one that tells us that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that happened.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would get things and made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why do he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> why I made a mistake that <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Soon that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in a <unk> he opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me with me that if I had the efforts to be perfect to be perfect to make any more mistakes I would put away from those voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it went back to happen.
Two years later, I was an editor at the emergency department in a community hospital in a community in Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her because he was a little <unk>
He took him penicillin and sent him to his house.
But as he ran to the door he was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my shift from guard, my chief asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he gave the three words: Does it remember you?
Remember the patient he saw by a pain in the <unk>
He came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it's the top, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He fortunately, he didn't die.
You get <unk> antibiotics for <unk> and <unk> to a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then <unk> and came back to work, until it happened over and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the E.R. <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> <unk>
And we had an X-ray of a kidneys but it turned out, a colleague who was checking the patient <unk> some sensitivity in the bottom right corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it and see some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, called the surgeon.
They both were operated on, and they recovered well.
But each of the case I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful they've been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't get myself and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I teach this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- it would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The complete denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and the ones that disagree with and the ones that I know; they have <unk> and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to people who make mistakes, will be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
About 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've made a personal study of bad medical litigation and errors to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote to Toronto, Star <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where mistakes happens every single one of 10 drugs in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system where infection infections are increasingly and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24 Canadian <unk> by mistakes <unk>
The U.S. Institute of Medicine set up.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge goes up every two or three years, and we didn't get <unk>
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in his chest comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and suddenly my story was <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't have their symptoms always the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we are <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals to error, well, you won't get anybody.
And with respect to people who don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white art, it's already a custom that I would say, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, <unk> <unk> "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> down the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they could do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The philosophical doctor is human, and they know it, and it doesn't be proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn how to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way and for support for everyone to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes at time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I am a human <unk>
And I feel a lot, but it effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
You know how much we choose in a week?
Recently, I made a survey more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that says to choose a half a half a half a day.
It doesn't do a lot, in a research followed by a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded all the different tasks for these executives and the time that we are making decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> works for a week.
Naturally, every job involved a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required one hour or over time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many belong to the <unk> category and how many of an hour?
How does the way we deal with those decisions?
So today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing the overload of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
So as I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, as a blind, you raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
In another way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive to please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this <unk> supermarket at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> <unk> and this was when we took water from the <unk>
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I asked myself, why don't I buy nothing?
This is the shelf <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
And once I decided to visit the manager of the manager and said, <unk> well this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out to me the buses of tourists that came every day, usually with the cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hallway.
They had a different different classes.
They put a set to <unk> just to the entry of the store.
We put it out of six <unk> or from 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop to test the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60 percent, that when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there was only three percent got to buy <unk>
When I had six, we saw that 30 percent were bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably have <unk> <unk> less is good to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of behavior <unk> makes us well <unk>
We decided to not decide, even though this is not going to get us.
Right now the financial savings issue.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at decisions about savings for retirement from about a million Americans, in between 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of money <unk> in their savings plans for retirement, the program <unk> <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found out there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 choices.
We found that the greater the number of funds were <unk> there was less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the death rate was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offered a few <unk> the rate of participation went to the '60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the more people were the number of options, more people are going to be used to avoid the actions or hedge funds.
As much as the more choices, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we need to do to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three major negative implications for offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that it makes the decision that <unk> even though this is actually against interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health care.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively it goes better.
The main reason is that we were looking at that giant array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, contrast and pick up with that amazing <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so that they can test their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of strange <unk> options, there will be an increase in sales, <unk> costs, there's a better experience in the election.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> eliminated the products for sexual <unk> that they were less <unk> they grew up the <unk> in <unk> for two major sales and under cost.
You know that supermarket today, on average, they have 45,000 products.
In a store of Walmart is offering 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato tomato <unk>
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come up on how to manage the choices is <unk> by David <unk> the Harvard program.
All the employees at Harvard are automatically <unk> to a insurance fund of life.
They really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these are <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they cannot do their <unk>
This evening before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience on a vacation with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want to give you a round of applause. If you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually reached more hands.
All right.
And actually, you had more information in the first trial, than in the second trial, but I can <unk> it and say, they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the <unk> problem that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choice, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete, very concrete ways.
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average, when it uses debit cards that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
So this meeting that we would look at exactly as a <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that you would ask the staff to think about the positive things that they would take in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a magazine <unk>
We saw that in supermarkets, I went through the <unk> exhibition and the magazines of magazines can hold from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two shows of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This classification is completely useless.
The categories need to indicate something to whom they are not going to be <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
Who are I supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out we can drive a lot more information than we think about, if you only get it a little bit.
We need to increase behavioral complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision -- buy a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows us to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that each other.
<unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box of <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order in which the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from a lot of choices, 56 colors, about four <unk>
The other half of the customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you were <unk> the default button in every decision -- this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of different options to begin -- <unk> the default button over and over again.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options in many, they are still there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order where the information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although you choose the box of changes not to say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the overload of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternatives to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented them were designed to help manage <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their business, or for people who are going to work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is to be careful to <unk>
And the more careful being in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> in the <unk> East Germany, if you had a typewriter to write it should be <unk> in the government.
He had to register a sheet of text from written with the machine.
And this is why the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written with the wrong message they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, the very much that this will be the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer of any larger manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having some yellow print on each page that you follow a pattern that makes you own on one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three major causes of problems on the web.
If you look at what's happening in the online world, we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to earn a lot of money, a huge amount of a huge number.
There are really a lot of a lot of <unk> online, <unk> that you would use money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthieu Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media through <unk> <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought it in a <unk> computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you know her <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> that of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going from wrong with worse.
In the future, most <unk> crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate the protests, they motivate the opinions, they motivate you.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months on the online <unk>
Those are the three <unk> <unk> the criminals who do for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who do for protest and the last group are the national United States of the U.S.
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or, actually, it was.
<unk> the <unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
It was the safety of the site and brought up a <unk>
I asked the last week and I asked the Dutch government, asked one of the leaders if <unk> <unk> the death of people causing the attack to <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how people die because of a attack of these?
<unk> is an effective authority.
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we <unk> an authority foreign authority.
And they were <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> <unk> headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes of a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a big scale the communications of the country.
They had sold this tool.
The company is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools to government governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you are suspected in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But now it's more there.
<unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and listen to the online discussion, to get our data.
When we think about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do we <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play with privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right than we're going to do today, be forever.
We were blind in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be concerned about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park National Park.
<unk> National Park has no fences in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate into the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only driver's <unk>
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and that's why we value them.
So I grew up with a lot of lions.
They are the warriors who protect our community and cattle, and they're also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park, of Nairobi.
A child in my community, six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought to lions give them fear.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because it even helped lions see the pen of far.
I didn't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick lions so they believed it was close to the <unk>
But lions are very smart.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing isn't moving, it's always here.  So I jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions didn't come out.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with the one that will turn off the lights.
And this is a little <unk> <unk>
It was all <unk>
As you can see, the solar panel load up the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity in the small box, and I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how you see lions when they come from night.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> to lions so that I am walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the houses of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights up.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by Kenya, to frightening other predators as dense <unk> and it's also using it for elephants elephants from their farms.
Because of this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funding and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the lawns of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see flying planes and told me that someday I would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in a plane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to get to be a engineering engineer and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and to the lions, we can be with lions without a conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What is the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do an electric <unk> CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you already invented electrical fences -- but I want to make mine.
CA: So I heard it once, and right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I had a couple of people because I got a <unk>  CA: On the canyon. Richard <unk> are a big thing.
We're going to <unk> it in every step that <unk> my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying <unk> story -- but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public performance.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and myself never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When we did this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're putting together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're prepared to die."
He was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
One woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child in her arms looking at her mother looking at her mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care and their families.
A huge famine <unk> in North Korea.
In the end, over a million North America died during the famine and only a few survived they survived grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more frequent <unk> <unk> all around me was completely in dark in the night except by the lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North America to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river, sometimes.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as a refugee camp.
But I suddenly learned that it's not only extremely difficult, but dangerous, because the North Europe in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to an awful destiny of the North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested for Chinese police and <unk> at the police station.
Someone had been accused me by being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer told another one, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum.
But many can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though there were <unk> they were eventually released after an international pressure.
These North America didn't have so much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans haven't had so much luck.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard only to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, all of their world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to be a <unk> going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
It was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of <unk> <unk>
I even went through a crisis of identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call with a pride of mine.
Although I went to the life in South Korea it was not easy, made a plan. I started studying for the test of income to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The U.S. authorities had a little bit of money that sent my family, and as blame my family was going to be shifted to the force to a block in the <unk>
They had to run immediately.
I started planning how to help them escape.
The North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese -- I had to take it in some way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and approached by a official police officer.
He asked the <unk> and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came to my family, <unk> I stood up and I told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated to cross the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was liberated in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything by releasing my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the <unk> <unk>
I was going to come and came between the office of immigration and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man said, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind asking to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I gave him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and to take them out of prison.
I took it up with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I am helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The bad unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the people to come to the <unk> when more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I came up with South Korea, and I got around South Korea.
But its freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language practice and work and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North America an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans -- all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South Center.
This is Center -- <unk> shops and fast food <unk>
So the city planners come together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles to the South Los Angeles as though this is actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Los Angeles --  <unk> <unk> fast, fast terrain.
Just like <unk> million other Americans, live in a food desert. The Los Angeles Center for the food places to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the places of food to bring kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases in Los Angeles Center in the South.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I think this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of home you see the effects of <unk> that the current food system has in their <unk>
I look at wheels of wheels and sold as a <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of driving 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that doesn't have <unk>
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet for 45 feet me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what I come up in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This was how I decided to keep it going.
So my group and I, <unk> Green <unk> we set up and we started plant our food forest -- trees -- you know, the nine complete vegetables ...
What we do, we are a kind of paid paid group to move ahead of all the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city I left, and I got a little bit of <unk> saying that I had to take my yard, the <unk> made <unk>
And I said, "Go on, right?
A court store for planting food in a piece of land that no one <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had been written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It's 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why on Earth doesn't look like this?
We had a plant to take a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up there.
I'm going to become part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden -- land like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the Earth can be done, if you let it be your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how does it affect people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education, as a transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They get rid of how it affects the guys.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one time that came to a mother and his daughter, they were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my yard, and they were looking very <unk>
I, you know, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not how people go to steal your <unk>
So I say, "Oh my God, I don't fear that you go to <unk>
So that's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it, but at his time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another time that I put in a garden on a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant with their mom and their grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, and so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a couple of 50 people that come, work and <unk> every single volunteer plan.
If kids cultivate <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you grow some tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and the body, they eat blind what they put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which you're true. I see kids that are in this path designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take <unk> and convert them into healthy <unk>
I didn't get <unk>
I'm not talking about free things, because the free is not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to get people to work the people in the street, who know the joy, and the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets in farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you take your <unk> take your <unk>
That is the weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, they don't call me sitting in comfortable and have meetings to talk to you about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
strong. Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very good road here.
It's made from <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in asphalt that you can have.
And especially if you go on <unk> and these cars go out that's not very nice.
Furthermore, asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a silent road on it.
The solution for that is to make asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, it has pores and water can go through it, so all the water rainwater goes into the sides and will have a road for which it's easy to drive, and they will not make it more water.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollow, all of the noise disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is it <unk> You see that on this road rocks and <unk>
So first a stone, then several more and more and more and more and more, and <unk> -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> of the light <unk> the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if you were <unk> they will become <unk> and they get thrown out of the <unk>
So, if you drive the road, you get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> <unk> of that to clean up, and we can cut the steel wool into very small pieces and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat heat, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, melt the <unk> the flow of the <unk> the flow of these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> oven, because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here to the stage.
<unk> <unk> is a similar system.
I put the show that now I'm going to pull out what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
So we tried a lot of samples there and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the freeway, and we had to do a <unk> <unk> to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of payload on them, and then we had a lot of our <unk> machine, and we knew them and we went back to it.
We can repeat this a lot of times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using steel fibers to remove these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even you can double the lives of the surface of the surface and actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they're curious about if this worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how it's acting for it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to the BBC in his little gray radio.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news generally <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what it was, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old, when the Taliban were <unk> in Afghanistan and they made it illegal to be in school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who couldn't be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we were able to make them <unk>
Every day, we would take a different route so that nobody could talk to where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in market bags so that it seems like that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us changed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
Once in a while, school was suddenly <unk> for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you are."
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and daughters <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> from a remote province in Afghanistan. <unk> in which their daughter, my mother, out to school, and so his father was doing it.
But my young mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It was taken two years ago, to turn our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in receiving education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, even though the risk of <unk>
For him, there was a higher risk to not educate your children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were moments where I was very frustrated for our life and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up -- but my father said, "You can lose everything that you have in life.
They can steal your money. They can <unk> to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to do it.
So, you still want to be <unk>
I have 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself a proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate his daughters, it was one of the first to <unk>
He was not only <unk> from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I am the first woman, I carry it down the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream of big, but my family has even more big dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of what <unk> <unk> first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country is still risky for girls to go to school.
What's exciting is I see the students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like my friend, <unk> by them, despite them and even in front of an anonymous opposition opposition to it.
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went out of the way to his village, and literally, <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would come back.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but we don't hurt the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized in Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who are <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of their daughter and he sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been the key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> convincing of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school is being told in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
We would think that these changes didn't last a lot after the retreat from the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were looking for them, and I see a <unk> future and lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day girls in the <unk> I would tell you.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since that the Tunisian revolution was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution as a <unk>
A forces with a lot of other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And the <unk> was a great revolution.
Women, and young men who were <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> each of the regime, they have billboards for freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a lot of courage to meet the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and a loss of about 50 thousand dead, we managed to liberate our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of human society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, and I've asked a lot of other women, to rebuild civil civil society, <unk> a <unk> and fair transition to democracy and national reconciliation
There were roughly 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I started to organize workshops from developing capabilities, and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and our right to the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> that was <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
By time, our initiative was sold and successful.
Women won a <unk> of Congress in the early elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of the election and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the U.S. artist and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the U.S. officer.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> human rights violations.
Our society, made out of a revolutionary mindset, and it became more <unk> and it has been away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and vengeance became the icon of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today to do it with our success story of <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, we choose to get wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choices didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
<unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by the selfish policies of domination, and <unk> both men like for women?
Maybe what they were missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than I needed the choices that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs <unk> representation of the female more than going to need <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as an agents of an outrage and call me <unk>
We need to start acting as compassion agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female discourse that not only <unk> but it also puts it in practice the mercy instead of why collaboration is where collaboration instead of the competition, the inclusion place of the <unk>
These are the ideal that a Libya, Libya, by war, needs desperately in order to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and <unk> between the female perspectives and the <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we make it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> female and <unk> that highlights all of the humanity that men and women, the ones that all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so, like the uterus covers completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all of existence.
So this is what he said, "My <unk> <unk> all the things."
This is what it looks like, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
They will all tell you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a <unk> question, which has a equally equally <unk> response.
This is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the one that everybody else is <unk> Why is it left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old, I had just met at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times the man, that I believed my soul <unk> I would put my head with a <unk> loaded with bullets from <unk>
The man who loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun into my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a Protestant <unk> <unk> <unk> where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University and I have a MBA in <unk> of the <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington, <unk>
I have almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all of the religions, all of the religions and education.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> relationships -- <unk> and <unk> or said otherwise in the families, the last place where we would want or we expect to find <unk> because the domestic abuse, it turns out so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who <unk> it and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
It was 22 years old, and in the United States of the United States, the women in between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and more than 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, <unk> night.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and he started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he also had just taken out of a university of the <unk> <unk> and he worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me about that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a field of the field.
I had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of mate.
He did it especially at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved all of me -- which was list, that I had gone to Harvard, who would put passion in helping teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done it.
And it was why <unk> at that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much important for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I don't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York City and let my dreams of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I went to my job and <unk> and I went into Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> which was entering a head in a physical, financial trap carefully ready.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to the New England you know, that site where they were supposed to be so safe to be able to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one he threw it underneath the pillow on our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those guns because of the trauma that lived in a small time.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me and even though I never had lifted my hand, my life was serious about danger, every minute of every day.
The first physicist physicist came up five days before our wedding.
They were the seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's suit, and I married him.
Despite what had occurred, was sure that we were happy to live happily forever, because I loved him and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just made sense very <unk> for the wedding and the fact that they form a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I never would do harm.
I spent twice as much in our <unk>
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey, they went through the traffic and threw a Big Mac <unk>
<unk> followed <unk> or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One of every three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Disease Control Center that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why do I get <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man in the world who could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question that everybody else does is, why don't you simply don't get <unk>
Why don't I get <unk> I could have been at any time.
So for me this is the saddest question and painful question that people, because we, the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in the cases of domestic violence happen after the victim has finally put to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has become married, <unk> from financial resources, and manipulation of the criminal justice system to the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend a little bit of time without the man who are going to get to their mother.
And then we continue to ask why it's not just going on.
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved it, I would have killed if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told all the world: I told the police, my neighbors and family, and my friends and family, and I'm here today because all of you will tell me.
We have the trend to <unk> victims as <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people is a way to say <unk> is yours for <unk> as if the <unk> victims intentionally <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to us and they would promote their lives joyful lives and happy, and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out I'm actually a victim and a survivor.
I became married with a nice, cute man and kind of got those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to do is ever going to have ever ever more, it would ever be a charged gun pointing my head in the hands of someone who says he wants me.
At this moment, you are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which is a <unk> but all this time, I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now that they're being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Gay abuse only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They took the <unk> to the light talking about it with their children, their colleagues and family.
They take their vision of survivors as fantastic and <unk> that have a <unk> future.
<unk> the <unk> signs of violence to intervene on the climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
Together we can convert our bed, our tables and our families on the oasis and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call a <unk> Cameron and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel like at this moment there is a little tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed in this way.  Luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing in a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they were <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but I find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to go through this sweater, because it's when they're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as long as I cover my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I have changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I was going to put the back and make it <unk> the child's hair.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I did two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, even though shallow and <unk> has a big impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my work, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a <unk> way.
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
And I always say, <unk> was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made myself model is because I won the genetic lottery, and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this heritage.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically wired for <unk> we have also associated with a high and <unk> shape, and to a white skin.
And that's my <unk> <unk> that I've known to take to make money.
And I know there are people in the public that now show <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> in the fashion that <unk> Hold on, <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing both of the models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told all and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- I mean, less than four percent, they were not white <unk>
The next question that people always do is it might be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take care of that.
But then, what I would say to each of these girls is why you can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon and the <unk> and a <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first.
If after this <unk> <unk> I still want to be a model, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> chief American magazine or the <unk> executive CEO or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model to say that you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have taken your studies, and you have a copy and a couple of jobs to your backs, no matter what you think about, you know, if you think you want to be president of the United States, but your copy of the United States of clothes for 10 years, people would look at you <unk>
The next question that people are always doing is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, it was virtually <unk> all the photos, but that's just a little part of what happens.
This was the first picture to me, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have a period of my time.
I know we're entering the personal domain, but it was a child.
So I was looking at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
I'm at a <unk> party a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and people and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always doing is: <unk> things for free?
I have too many <unk> <unk> and I have too much use, except for the previous couple -- but the privileges that I get is the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to speak.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to wear money, and they gave me free for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped into a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges because of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their way no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and the past year, of the teenagers who were <unk> and <unk> 86 percent were black and Latino men, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York City, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It's about how many times I was <unk> and <unk>
When I research for this talk, I found out that about 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure out to 78 percent to 78 percent.
So the last question that people do is, how is life in a model?
And I think the answer you're expecting is: If you're a little thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll feel very happy and I mean.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you have it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, clever people.
And this is all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask them, with some more thin legs and the brightest hair will be happier.
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most prestigious legs and the brightest legs and the <unk> and the more women are physically physically insecure the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that held from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image of the image that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was most enough enough to support a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 <unk> pictures -- and I didn't go to the <unk>
There were no <unk> or no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a minimum bit of <unk>
In fact, most of them took random tourists at random.
My story begins in the city of New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the <unk> corner and five.
He happened that we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I approached the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to <unk> New York City <unk> and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that they were going to make us <unk>
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and fortunately, never one has been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in a way that was in a way for five years to understand it.
These pictures are much more than a particular moment or a specific journey.
It's also a way to stop time in October week and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because although we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how it perceives with everything.
That particular time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with the whole year.
Recently, on one of the trips, we were walking, when all of a sudden, they stopped in my dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the frame of dolls that <unk> in the previous <unk>
And it described to me what had felt like five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first nine years ago.
And now what he looks at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 photos, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that pulls up the picture.
I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you don't get to get closer to someone and asked him, and he pulls us up a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney <unk> <unk> characters as silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press and laughter, you applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament are not clean up the environment --  <unk> not help prevent the <unk>
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> in the New World states that are mostly in the <unk> like <unk> and the <unk> of the Old World species, where we have 16 species. From these 16, 11, they face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> are important, first of all, provide green green services <unk>
They're our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
They took the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria. They help <unk> that it would not be because they would spread and causing great losses from livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and Under Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, they make a lot of very important <unk> <unk> in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities that are using this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years -- and the reason is because they fall out of the <unk> consumption of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug as the <unk>
This drug has been banned from veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Since there's no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge amount of time for <unk> -- the number of cases of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be top of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we need to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the birds. The cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there's a terrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so it will focus on a sustainable problem, it's not going to do nothing.
We need to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about looking at the <unk> of the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. They can write a letter to your government and tell you we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you get out of this room, they will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that it changed the opinion because he saw it flying without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, being much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and all that I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
<unk> to <unk> <unk> a young man, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
<unk> at the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that I would do is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach the people of Zambia to grow food.
So we came up with <unk> <unk> south to this absolutely amazing valley that descends into the <unk> River, and we teach the local local tomatoes Italians and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were giving them to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>   -- we were aware that the local people in so fertile valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't look at it, we just said, "Thank you for God we are here."   <unk> time to save the people from Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa grew up <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato <unk> to this size in Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is.
When the tomatoes were cute <unk> <unk> and the red morning, about 200 <unk> they showed up from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here --  "Why don't you get it, "You're never <unk>
I was thinking that only we had mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, they did, what they did, what they did, what they were doing, what they were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western <unk> we've given to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
It was part of an African woman, the damage that we've done.
Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or are we <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture like my kids, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I treat all of a different culture as I would be my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little <unk> <unk> written by <unk> who said for most economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference and put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to be able to give those 27 years only to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never contribute anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We met in a coffee. We sat down in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give a sense of somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, for once, for once, but not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell them in a public meeting, what you want to do with their own money, what have they <unk>
So, planning has this point of blind.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they're not attending their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business who sets up with you in your house at home, in the coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this condescending junk where we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on march, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And so --   So --  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of <unk>
Peter <unk> one of the most skilled business teaching business of history, died to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before it was involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> was actually incompatible with a society and a company of company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business <unk>
So now we're going to go through reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you to your <unk> you have to be fantastic to <unk> and then they will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion?
What do you talk about you is this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossils that we have the fossil revolution that are not renewable <unk> and from a moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a lovely story that was in a magazine magazine done many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the <unk> I met this group of people gathered together and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> life in New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States there were <unk> generic companies <unk> <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you a <unk>
Otherwise they won't come to talk to you.
Then you have to offer you an absolute dedicated service, <unk>
And then then I will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company, the bigger company, it has to be able to do three things, the product that you want to sell has to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic <unk> and you have to have a great financial <unk>
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can be doing, selling and look for the money itself.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 <unk> icons in the Muslim world, <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
I don't have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he began.
Nobody begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of small businesses in coffee bars in bars in bars in bars and who will do for you, what someone did for you, what someone did by this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who will ask you, what needs you.
What can you?
Well, you can <unk> you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The people who are around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we didn't change a lot of knowledge to share the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask more things without calling the door to a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs.
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the wild giants that give shadow to <unk> <unk> <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It's always going to go to the music.  There's a parade in New York City,  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the largest <unk> of the U.S.
I live near this house and I thought how it could convert it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
Her death was suddenly suddenly a sudden and he said.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And it produced me a profound gratitude for the living time.
He gave it clarity to the significant things of my current life.
But let me keep this look at my everyday life.
I think it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget the really important thing for one.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this house left on a giant <unk> and he painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before he died <unk>
So, <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was full and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
He said, "Before I die to die by <unk>  "Before I died, I want to sit on the line of <unk>
He said, "Before she died, I want to sing for millions of people.
He said, "Before you die I want to plant a <unk>
He tried to die outside of the <unk>
He said, "Before I ever died, I want to help you more."
He tried to die at the rescue of <unk>
He tried to die to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about going to accommodate the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is most important for us as we are growing and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in civic center, we made a kit, and now have been walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is the time and our relationships with other people.
And in our era of distractions in the increasing, it's more important than ever ever, to find the ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is brief and fragile.
death is something that we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that prepare for death is one of those things that are more power.
You think about the death -- our life.
Our shared spaces can better reflect what we care as individuals and as a community and with more media to share hopes and stories, the people around us, cannot only help us improve places, can help us improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single petition.
Please tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's very <unk>
We don't speak, but transmits joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
Is it <unk> it happens to happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and look at it, has never been <unk>
When I sing our early childhood, trying to speak to the words that I could not even be able to do -- it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel he's 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year where every single songs came out of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, to be pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
They don't seem <unk>
But most people agree.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what led to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you didn't consider it within it, it could only mean one thing that they were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those least familiar term with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical abilities.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, from there that will be so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes is diagnosed -- a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new thing to be in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in their own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that would have <unk>
As I grew up, it got more different, and the differences were getting more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature, a kid who looked at the world without a <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change by normal.
<unk> happens by high the beauty that they give us the differences and the fact that it doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means that there's a different vision of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you, it would be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in its inner and honestly, the pursuit of normal is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> the progress and the change of the time we try to be like others.
Please tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been to be <unk> in the middle of the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a professor of communications, who gave a kind of communication to graduate students.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> of these students with their great minds, their big books and their big unknown books.
But when they developed those conversations, I felt what <unk> had had a sense when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
Just as I felt when I had these conversations with the students, I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a lot of communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges from energy and health care and health care, and if we don't know we don't understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility for scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and that its engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
We don't just tell you that you study the <unk> but study the <unk> which are the <unk> structure of our bones, because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when they're describing their science, carefully <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, they can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing as I do stupid things.
Instead, as Einstein, as Einstein said, everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without compromise the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies and they are kind of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when I present their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you asked why they're called <unk>  What do the <unk> the bullets are killed, and the bullets are killed by their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's supported too much in the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this example of <unk> Brown is much more effective to show that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that actually inspired the only design of the Eiffel <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide the graphs that are going to make our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they are <unk>
And I think these are just some keys that can help others open the door and look at the country of wonders that science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all media -- <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English Oxford is <unk>
Just because it sounds great.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor at the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who looks for a public charge no matter party -- and that when I <unk> you get it through the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what <unk> means.
One thing to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to master their language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to give the newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And all this was because of the courage of a guy with the very unusual name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by the <unk>
They threw him in the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to face them, and at the end of it had such a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use recorded of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most of them think it <unk>
It's not. It's a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to actually show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So, they had to tackle the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know that.
How do you call the leader of a <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They introduced all kinds of suggestions that they might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them would just call it <unk>
They thought it was to be tested quality.
And not even with that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen King for a given term.
And I could have <unk>
Everyone got tired <unk> because this debate would be taken over for three weeks.
I read the day of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of <unk> didn't want the Washington of power.
They didn't want to call it King for if it didn't give him to her or his own ideas.
So they wanted to give the <unk> more <unk> <unk> and more unfortunate than they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. It was already before, but it only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who is going to take a serious title with a very ridiculous degree and <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> for the President.
President Barack Obama was lucky to keep there waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> that we will keep waiting for <unk> years more.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important, and this is the title of President of America doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of flying vehicles or so on.
The reality and the story has been endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> -- well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate he won and the House of <unk> because nobody is going to feel humble when you tell you that now are the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do with you with <unk>
Politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, really change it much more the words than they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet under land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear the voices they talk about, but most of all, that cacophony of male <unk> and stones with primitive.
Like the rest of them, I carry a cheap <unk> of light -- they put on the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the branches of the branches of that hole in that hole from a meter that falls hundreds of feet on the ground.
And my hand -- and suddenly I remember a mining that I met with days before he lost the control and got <unk> <unk> in that hole.
As I talk to you today, these men are at the depths of that hole, and their lives without paying or reward and, often, dying.
And I walked out of that hole and I went home, but they might never will, because they are stacked out of slavery.
Over the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has been to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was a world in the world, but not to such a degree.
When we finished talking to me, I felt very <unk> I was honestly getting rid of this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So it started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
A few of you even, I considered the second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation is that there are currently more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced during all of the <unk> slaves for the whole <unk>
A hundred years ago, the cost of a pharmaceutical slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 people are today.
However, today we can benefit from entire families for generations by <unk> debt debt per inch.
Amazingly, slavery generates profit over <unk> billion a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then find that they're forced to work without paying <unk> under threat to violence and they can't escape.
Today, slavery operates in <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce are disposable them.
slavery exists in almost the world and yet it is illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the brick <unk>
This strange show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> <unk>
They put in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, in fact, entire families -- entire families -- in fact, entire families -- the mechanically ventilated families, in their heads, until 18 at the same time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee to eat, nor to drink, and the severe <unk> made me pee very <unk>
They were so <unk> they were the heat and the dust that my camera was too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, I was like, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly and he grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it here."
And it explained very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't get any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
It could put them in a worse situation than they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for his release and trusted that I was doing it.
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children carrying rocks for miles through <unk> <unk> to trucks that were waiting for.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children than the load and the children were <unk> their heads with leg belt, made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been so all his life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers took their freedom, the <unk> they had their home.
When you hear the word slavery often we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness warned me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
I was driven by a few stairs <unk> which gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local prostitution for force <unk>
They have small rooms -- private rooms where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them were forced to entertain customers and to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of it is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their customers.
On the <unk> I remember there will be a sense of <unk> <unk> and in that instant, I barely could imagine what it should be stuck in hell.
I just had a little <unk> the stairs where he <unk>
There was no <unk> doors.
There were no windows enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because you touch a topic so hard, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual traffic is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were whole family families in the trade of the silk.
This is a family portrait of family.
<unk> hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
And yet, we hope, however, can be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we actually pay our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in the <unk> lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I got a quick look.
I saw what it seemed to be a <unk> family in a boat, two older brothers -- some younger children, a little bit older -- right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> families and they kept forced to work with a huge deal in these boats in the lake, despite not to swim.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of the trees in the <unk> lake in Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, and with fear, it will be thrown into the water to release the branches.
Many <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and like all life has been treated with <unk> <unk> tries to be the younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they went to the latest morning, but they had been working on the last one.
It was in the cold night and <unk>
And I would point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village in fishermen.
I met it in a refuge in which we <unk> the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will be because of someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> for a road in Ghana with <unk> partners the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their bike. suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and touched the window.
They asked us to push it through a land road to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to get out of the car, and asked the driver to go out very quickly.
Then he pointed down to this path barely visible and said, "This is the path, this is the road.
As we started to go down, we removed the <unk> that we took off the way and after walking around an hour we found that the way was going on by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as I put in these waters down to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
Many women had children tied up to their backs and, while they were looking for gold, <unk> in the waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have to be 90 feet and these people carry their heavy heavy stone bags that then will be shipped to another area in which the stone to be able to extract the gold.
At the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer at it, to the margin we see at other less lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up as this victim of tuberculosis and the <unk> of mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, his uncle took him to work with him in the mines.
When he died, his uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle who will be slave in mines.
When I met him, I had worked on the mines 14 years and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so severe that doctors were supposed to be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it is forced to work night and day in that mine.
Even so, he dream of being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, <unk> to a very expensive possibility that inspires me much respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
They knew that your images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give testimony to them and we're going to make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can look at each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not rocket people, and they are people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that happens that I don't think about these beautiful, beautiful people that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images wake up a force where you can see them in people like you, and I hope that force turn into a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do applied mathematical math and there's a peculiar problem for whom we <unk> are the management effort.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk> --  who will see later on.
But <unk> demand a degree of extraordinary education, a high level of skill and probably some initial <unk> that might well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time was a ballet ballet dancer <unk>
Over the last few years has been making progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress of an objective way and ultimately, the only way we'll know whether there is a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement have no biological markers -- so they don't use the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do this. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of the clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test for ourselves?
You don't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do, as a conventional form of a try, you can see, in some sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vibrating strings.
It shows someone who gives you a healthy sound when it emits sounds of a vocal sounds, we can imagine how to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds, and we all have the genes that needs the <unk> for example.
And as the shame requires a remarkable training.
Let's think about time that leads to a kid learning to speak.
So from sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as they <unk> and as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of the irregular <unk> of string strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
So how do you compare these exams based on the voice with the clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but also the exams based on voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They are very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're at minimal cost, and we all know what happens.
And when something takes a lot of <unk> it appears to have massive scale.
These are some incredible goals for <unk>
We can reduce the patient difficulties from patients.
I wouldn't need to go to the clinic for <unk> <unk>
With high monitoring we could get goals.
We could make a massive massive <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So by giving you today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the so-called Parkinson's <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start dealing with these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, it can be able to call under the price and leave recordings for a cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's take all of these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you'll be able to say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What are you coming from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call -- you have to indicate whether or not the disease is, TR: Sure.
<unk> You can see, some people may not be <unk> You may not have it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at <unk> the factors of confusion in pursuit of the real markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have an accuracy of accuracy at this point?
A lot more than that.
In fact, my graduate student, I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works in the mobile phone network, too, which is the project. Now we have one 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max public <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were focusing on the darkness, on no windows without windows and large, we avoid the solar light.
We do the thin models still more <unk> the perfect skin -- we do the impossible, and we are going to focus on press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, as the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Soon time later, an organization where I was <unk> there were <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the team of response.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On the 13th of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The level of water recorded over 24 feet tall and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
They get rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We removed the slime and leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons of dead fish dead, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers as the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> pictures and cameras and cards.
Everyone did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of villages around the <unk>
It wasn't until so I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of <unk>
It helped clean the bathrooms -- <unk> giant <unk> giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I took them and I had the honor of that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspirational had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went beyond my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, some of them were still in the lab -- I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people that could do the same.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all of all.
I was not too <unk> but where the water had been <unk> the face of the girl had to have a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the step of time, they got a little bit more photos and it took more <unk> so it went back to Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people in 12 countries volunteered to help.
In two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a village to the north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, of course of the <unk> of the photos.
It could be a time for an hour. I could have a <unk>
It could be a months.
So this <unk> had to draw almost to hand by hand using the areas which color and detail was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures would make all of these pictures <unk> covered in bacteria, with algae, and even oil, all of it along with the time time I continue to <unk> it was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless he was clean dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We had lucky <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more the photos already <unk>
As he said once he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky enough in relation to the photos.
He had started <unk> it himself but stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not be <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When they picked their photographs shared some of their history with us.
A couple of colleagues in her husband found photos in a fire station between the rubble of the bottom too far away from where her home, but his colleagues had it <unk>
The day of tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave,
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their young children, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different school.
One of them was caught in the water.
It took a week to find all his family and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her her pictures of her photos for 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could do to look, something that he could remember from the past day that he had not been marked on the day of March when everything in his life changed or it was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up to there -- <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up to <unk> <unk> photographs -- the great majority -- most of them came to the hands of their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us return to 90 families and hundreds of all the whole <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than <unk> and materials, most of them in ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
One picture is a memory of someone or something, a <unk> someone wanted.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we would add but the first thing to look for.
This is what the project was, of restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this brings somebody, a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger and putting something, using their talent for something that are not perfect physical models of perfect skin.
To finish up, I would like to read this email -- I emailed it to the day that I went from Japan after six months.
While I was going, I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
In particular, a picture of women from the grandmother to the little girl, gathering around a baby, and gathering around a baby, and I was <unk> because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my newborn daughter hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> was inspired by awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that runs through an exhibition in an exhibition from just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion of light in motion.
And so with that we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without the X-ray of the <unk> and challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it into a laser <unk> and it is, in a number of <unk> to create a <unk> pack of it just a millimeter away.
And that package from photons, -- that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet as well.
If we take that bullet and this pack of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do you disperse those photons inside this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in the <unk>
Now, all this --   Remember that all of this is effectively in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light on motion.
Coca-Cola is not going to do Coca-Cola --  -- <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle with a photons package that starts to <unk> and that inside, it starts to <unk>
And part of the light is <unk> and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally hit the cap and then explode in a number of directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table, and because of the insights of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and the current and we make it go the same distance and see it in slow motion at about 10 billion times, how much they think it would take us to sit at the movie?
One day? One week? Actually, every year.
It would be a very boring movie -- a slow bullet in motion.
And what about trying with nature <unk>
You can see the waves that <unk> from the table, of the tomato table, and the wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, and I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a chemical composition of it.
But if you look at this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why? Because the tomato thing is <unk> and the light is <unk> and the light is <unk> on its inside and it becomes a number of <unk> in a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera in India?
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture of a low exposure, it goes very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition -- so you just get a little bit of light.
So we sent that <unk> that package from photons, million times, and we recorded over and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data into crude and <unk> in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a future is able to see it after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door on the door. <unk> go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
We could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We've built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly at slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works, this is how fast, our <unk> has unique capabilities there.
It has very good resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects -- but we don't know what point corresponds to which distance.
When you project a laser you can record a picture of a physicist, which you see on the screen, doesn't make any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we'll try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the <unk> object.
Can we look at <unk>
This is our reconstruction one.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going around the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by the open windows.
Or could we build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite difficult, so this is actually a order to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new modality of visualization to solve the problems of developing health in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he himself was a scientist, it became the science of art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all of the data data that we collected every time is not just for scientific visualizations but we can be able to see it.
To create a new computer audio form with a slow camera and color code.
And look at those waves -- remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> in a second.
But this is also a fun thing.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects -- Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order of the events in the world sometimes appears to be invested in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile cell can make your life, and gives you individual freedom.
So with a mobile cell phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
You can tweet a mobile message and start a protest in Egypt.
So with a cell phone, you can record a song, you can put it up to <unk> and become famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people <unk> in search of a change.
This is the fall fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who are having a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Hands up your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's pretty much all of these today have a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about me, my phone, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Data <unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. was presented to a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European phone company, every European company, every single Internet provider has to store a wide range of user information.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sent a <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or his <unk>
And across Europe and he said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> Vietnam.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> that in that time I was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I got them to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer -- it was all blah.
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to give you a judicial demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end, I <unk>
<unk> the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court <unk> failed the <unk> for German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly little bit of brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> 30 thousand <unk>
And I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, "I want this information to happen.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the <unk> means.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom up and forwards and go forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> in train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, like, I call my wife and she's called, we talked a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call it between them.
And then one calls the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other to what time they call each other to sleep.
You can see all this stuff.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who you talk to who, who gives you an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The <unk> of the Berlin Berlin may never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to be <unk>
But <unk> and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you turn home to your friends that privacy is a <unk> value of the 21st century and it's not <unk>
When you're going to go home, you get back to your representative because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what about your phone company.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to remind you that they have to fight for <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi <unk> what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi <unk> what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, so we would <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
The P. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> no <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, while they are.
It just happens by accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration and I don't want any of us to present them.
It feels bad for me, because at some point of life, you want to be a <unk>
Let's go <unk>
<unk> <unk> are in the shopping center, drive in circles looking for lots and what do you see?
I was 16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
And also, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. <unk> is just one of them.
There's a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you probably should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same first.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City, I would do it.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't think <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "You can <unk> doing <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters, older sisters went to the public school, my parents went to the school system, and they were <unk> that I was also out of all the ultimate note -- all of the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another charter I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I would do it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking as a <unk> champion who has received many <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and they were all of the family.
There are now 20 Arab ones, and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as the campaign.
The people that I grew up with no problems with my faith.
But it seemed to be a lot of <unk> a lot of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating and so <unk> from dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Yes, in <unk> it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I would too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I didn't go.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we're not going to go to Palestine all the <unk> we would get away in <unk>
On the summer vacation I often tried to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> so I would wear cups of <unk> and I was <unk> on the <unk> Sea and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before it was <unk> it was a <unk> comedy that couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can do it on your head.
My parents had this idea that I could do anything, that any dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the University of the state of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the theater department.
And all of me <unk>
I did all the least intelligent, I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a piece called <unk> <unk> in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end, <unk> <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running into the director of the theater department, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask her why and she told me that because they believed that I couldn't do the stunt scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the venture stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that was literally born and they gave the actor without cerebral <unk>
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors for disabled papers.
And I walked back home, and my first tour, <unk> was an extra <unk>
My dream was true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see myself more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the principals of travel is not <unk> and we were not white, with disability.
You just give perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
In my first tour, I took comics recently from New York City to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that led when he dropped to the realize that he was at high speed on the New Jersey <unk> with a driver and <unk>
I worked in clubs across America and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you have never heard that little unpleasant rumor that women are not fun, and they are very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York City now at 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media, and at the time you remind the principals of travel that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs was much easier than fighting the challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to the news program by cable <unk> <unk>
I walked as if I went to a graduate dance, I went to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I lifted up at the desk desk to not get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they didn't come back.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just as I was <unk> and I hit my chair.
It's a fun thing that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people in the Internet are <unk>
They say that children are <unk> but they never had a girl who was no longer than the old girl.
Suddenly, my disability in the Internet became <unk>
I heard clips online with comments like, "Why do we <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk>
What disease does it have?
We should really pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even I would say, my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can't do somebody in a wheelchair.
<unk> are -- yeah, <unk> man. Come on.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the entertainment world.
The doctors were saying that I don't know but I'm here in front of you.
However, there are the media, but I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I arrived in a film with Adam <unk> and to work with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world is <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> children of <unk> a charity to give kids Syrian refugee kids -- a little bit of what my parents asked me.
It was the only time my father saw me to be alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know their name, but I know their story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives the little town to poverty and at the edge of the <unk>
Without it, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there are no opportunities, there is no work, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year we got anything.
One day he gets a guy who offers him to <unk> after dinner, <unk>
He meets a group of people, which gives him a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home.
They present a young guy.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky -- a bomb bomb.
That child in that little village with dreams of the great city -- was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a connected organization connected with al Qaeda.
So how a child story of a little boy trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start a future perspective, and this was the first thing that was arrived.
This was the first thing that took it out of what we call "the <unk>
And his story goes across urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> riots who are <unk> riots in London, which is looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of work, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
Often it's youth who suffer from the highest <unk> rates.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they weren't giving them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of access to terror, the door of access to violence, to <unk> will be the history of Vietnam.
And in my hometown of birth, the 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do virtually nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital.
I remember standing in the hospital to <unk> thinking, "Well, if I never gone?
And if I was forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor a juvenile leaders at a corporate future.
<unk> about 90 juvenile leaders, <unk>
We sat down and we had an rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
I had no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, because it was because I was a graduate college student, frustrated, that was the perfect white man for Al <unk> and other organizations terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to come from point A to the B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war, have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
He started <unk> motorbikes to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point expanding hundreds of bikes for the next three years.
Why is this a different story?
What does this story different?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
They encourage young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of business initiative and how to create a culture of business enterprise.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years ago, and until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from being sent from the overseas.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw <unk> flowers.
For those who grew up in the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and design design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, he could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for wedding and creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now is working on the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
You want to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the Mohamed presence had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, to work for government, but his story, its innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people to create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a great step, but young people need a lot to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to build them in the development and put it into their business.
We would encourage young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park Park culture, this is how it is called, when it's created, to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the bikes for him.
They gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their <unk> innovation and they will have more stories about flowers and <unk> of Peace <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> a <unk> area in the north of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be the way that we were <unk> we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with sight to a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
From the shed of the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with the hearts of apple <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
<unk> that were too lazy to pull out what they thought was going to be clean up his <unk>
That question followed with me, and they got a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where to <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
So here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean is our trash, and the <unk> of 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products -- every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities all around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed more to get more to them.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now not just traveling in the trucks. I was <unk>
And operated the mechanics and mechanical <unk> the snow.
It was remarkable privilege and amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as widespread as you believe, and in the days that it is very strong -- you will slow down quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of getting over their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of Bureau <unk> <unk> is one of the ten most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and pass through all the day and pass it around.
They just want <unk> so usually the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also, the trash is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the <unk> of trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also a way of breathing or circulation.
It's always going to be in motion.
And there's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think strongly that the <unk> of waste are the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste as efficient as efficient and effective every day, this starts to <unk> from their <unk> and their dangers are inherent in very real ways.
So we had controlled for decades and centuries they start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old old stuff, we don't have room for what the motors of economy start to fail when it's in danger <unk>
And I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just point out the relationship.
And then it's what I call our average speed speed that we need.
So I mean just the speed that we used to move in the <unk> time.
We usually don't have any <unk> and <unk> or take us into our coffee cup -- our bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We use them -- the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that is to take away from it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste collection that might help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow of the flow that they maintain is safe from ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I listened to the <unk> of a waste collection on the street, grabbed my son, <unk> and I went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of paper <unk> as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for my job that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "Let's be okay.
Let's be okay."
Soon after that, I began to investigate waste collection and went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together a lot of times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that I was right.
We're going to be right.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have to account for all the costs, even the real human cost of the work.
The city waste that we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistical statistic here.
So in the flow of your days and their lives, the next person you see someone whose work whose job is to be clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life to be part of the environment where architecture is naturally naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I took two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia, and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives are becoming an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example began with an invitation to design a shopping center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa,
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team, and to me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
And after seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects of the city.
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to employ a lot of energy because the lining of crystals generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's a temperate climate that's 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And thirdly, his view is nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a worth being a place to be so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was actually completed with the old market that is this structure in the open air where thousands of people are going and they buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the unfolding site, which is located in a very large area of a lot of the city growth, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was we created a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries from the building.
And this spreads with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space to open air in the building that would be <unk> by its own way, the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
And I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would give to the local weather conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric of concrete with <unk> to allow the air input to the air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the <unk> of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me to model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside of the building.
And this is <unk> with these little color crystals that use the light from the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center in it.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the shopping center because the end of the mall there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was far more economic -- not only because of the material compared to glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy energy for the building in a city where electricity is short almost every day.
So we got a big advantage to put <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, and they collect water for the inner skin.
It is waiting for the early year, because we're going through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a big, big project, the biggest that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
And during that analysis, I started attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of access doors by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was extend the streets and creating 12 initial blocks similar to the size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we pick up some <unk> strategic points in relation to the idea of doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as a <unk> part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we <unk> a scheme to make sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections for the way?
And it also responds to local norms that set up more density at higher levels and a lower density of the plant down.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving the community <unk> the space filled by construction.
It's where all the neighbors can go up and <unk> and make activities such as a race for two miles in the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same rate growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
It had huge amounts of very bright hair, and a little <unk> of <unk> <unk> was very strong for the capitals of states, very good at <unk>
And I ended up that year, and I was full of jealousy until I had <unk> my plan.
One day I stayed for a time after the school, I was a little afternoon, and I hid myself in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher and the <unk>
And then I did.
I took the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few things.
All the way --  And I set up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> they would <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows of <unk> and myself in a row of that, just because of being there, because I was <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never came up with me.
It's all obvious <unk>
I'm never going to tell you.
But most of all, I was fascinated by the reason why I was bothered by this little girl, so small, it was so good for <unk>
<unk> jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
The primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab that we study <unk> in all possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy, <unk> there would be no literature.
It wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no <unk> king and <unk>
I wouldn't have <unk>
<unk> the <unk> lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without ours, there's no <unk> I know it's <unk> to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, almost everyone has all.
This year is 100 years of their <unk> <unk> study for the <unk> study of the sexual <unk> and the <unk> of the ordinary <unk> -- my whole thing that we might have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- we have the details, right?
We think in a kid trying to reconcile sleep.
We think in a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard it is that image.
We forgot about the wrong thing that it is.
I mean, this is the books that Virginia <unk> said they were so hard as <unk>
I don't know what the cat, the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, that are reduced to the person, to their wish, their <unk> are a very good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being storytellers and the audience, we know exactly what details would happen to peg the <unk> right?
<unk> are doing all novelists <unk> and that's something that I understood understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure as well as right now.
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every single <unk> <unk> it detects in their lover -- it adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in their private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break through it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> emotion, <unk>
And what are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> from information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the great amounts of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> links well the <unk> language with jealousy.
When you <unk> it is in his agony of jealousy, soon listening behind the doors of the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of their lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're scientific research with true value value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make it seem like <unk> but in your <unk> they are search for knowledge, search for the truth, a painful truth -- in fact, to the <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk> <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to be, that makes us experience it causes to us a very profound range of feelings that was much more profound and vital than a wise man that can be <unk>
We're telling us that let's look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other excitement that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
There's some other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other excitement that teaches us to look at the intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young woman who was being consumed with the idea that his wife was <unk>
And Freud said there was something weird in that man who didn't get <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that she was doing his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
novels are very good at this.
And the novels describe very well how <unk> do you look at the intensity but without accurately.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> the more intensely we are, we became residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the <unk> are taking us to do violent or illegal acts of <unk>
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about my case at eight years, <unk> but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman in Michigan of 52 years old, was captured by having created a false account at Facebook since they were sent by <unk> by itself, for a year.
For one year, a whole year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend, I have to confess that when I heard this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How large, even though you do creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books who are trying to address our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of ours, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take her <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to get to the <unk> of your being and <unk> of what you ever have -- and it's under the floor -- <unk> your name, takes your <unk> cow bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the path of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, as well as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live at jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
novels show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not secure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I always think <unk> <unk> <unk> the head face of the rat <unk> <unk> which needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs your help, but I would do it with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of six <unk> once they were <unk> <unk> on all of his solution, <unk> comes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> that I don't want to hold your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional -- this scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be relative to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So while we hope that happens, we have the fiction for <unk>
Just fiction fiction -- jealousy.
The fiction used the <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet -- the scary Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> module of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the <unk> <unk> was the culmination of a collective <unk> process.
The Apollo program was the largest involved in peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of a day, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave you a 400,000 people and asked for 20,000 <unk> companies and universities and government agencies.
They died -- including <unk> <unk> <unk>
But before the <unk> program, 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which was where the <unk> died, the past year, is now the most <unk>
So why is it <unk>
They didn't have been a lot of <unk> 50 pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because the Kennedy President wanted to prove to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some ask, why do we <unk>
Why would it turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why can the mountain scale <unk>
Two years ago, why do you fly over the <unk>
Why is Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, it's hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the <unk> was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the significance of the powers of technology.
They were because it was something great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of tech <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line, and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the last half of the century, it was <unk> and removed the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle -- but in 1969, the <unk> crew flew to 40,000 miles a hour.
Since 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than Apollo crew <unk> and the happy optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> when we see that the technology would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or to feed the world population, seem to have been <unk>
I remember the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we didn't get to the <unk> tube of the rocket.
I knew that this would be the last mission to <unk> but I was completely sure that I would come to see colonies on Mars.
So that's what happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have been <unk> and we had enriched with trivial toys like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't enact the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an unintended explanation in Silicon Valley, which <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> in the years in which Intel would be, Intel -- Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused the creation of <unk> ideas for the funding of <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were on their peak point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment investment that could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always been problems to invest with benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital to invest in technologies that need a huge amount of capital that has never invested in the development of technologies to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you take it.
NASA has actually designed a plan.
But go to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We will not go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things than to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar -- wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete in price.
Now, technologists, of the entrepreneurs and economists agree on what policies and international treaties the development of an effective energy -- <unk> a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see an energy policy in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seemed technological, they are not going to be.
We know for a long time that famines are a result of failure in the road <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and food route, but there will be massive as bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The Nixon Nixon declared the war in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant cancer, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to be found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we cannot solve problems with technology.
We can and we need -- but these four elements have been <unk> political leaders, and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem, and we must understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like this as a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems, it serves with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> hard and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like we explore the solar system.
In general, go to the Moon it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And I really, was not even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They are so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decrease of trust, is a very general belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should get the trust.
I think <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think is a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that it may have fallen down in some activities or institutions and that might be augmented in others.
I don't have sure.
But I can turn on <unk> polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at <unk> polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still quite <unk> judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But is this enough?
What <unk> opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you're looking at is attitudes <unk> that people manifests when they ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> at <unk>
You probably want to ask the question, "To do what?"
And that would be a very strong answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to place the confidence in <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel by a certain kind of <unk> official or a person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say, I trust a certain teacher that I know to give the class of reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but not, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
And I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they are trying to <unk> good inherent judgment in fact you trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It is not that the goal that I <unk>
I intend to have more confidence in what it is about trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> you don't trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who are doing their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> intelligence, that's the right goal.
One time you say, yes, that means that what it means in the first place is not the trust, but trustworthiness.
What is it about doing a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that a person is <unk> in the raw materials, and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be <unk>
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible we could not trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very confident that you can do certain things, but I see that they will make your own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to have to do before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've been trying to build <unk> systems for all sorts of <unk> professionals, officials and others, that made us easier to judge the trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make <unk> <unk> that will be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we will argue that the theory of accountability that is destined to ensure the <unk> and <unk> evidence is actually making the opposite.
What they're doing is <unk> the work of people who have to do hard work, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You must have all of you know the similar examples.
We would take all that, by the target.
I believe that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were going to be worthy of being worthy of trust and <unk> the people that we're reliable and if we want to determine whether other people or political officials are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple action, the <unk> what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should be able to rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit the trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately is defining because they give them other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because of course, you can't afford it, usually all the time.
But you also have to give you evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That's every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says that I can <unk> it without giving us a lot.
I wear them and get it back and get it back and change them by the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people rely on is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when the other person is worth of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers we have come up with <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been more and more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a glass display, and the power of computing has become accessible to everybody.
But I wonder, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
So first he created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong wave against the screen would be transformed by your physical body to the pixels.
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool break down the barriers.
But the two hands remain still on the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity
In the <unk> <unk> division of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital field of work.
They had a <unk> Norden bombsight to detect your fingers and the face, and now you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and the files have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and try to highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that are down on every floating screen.
architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we would be able to <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make the digital information come to us?
We had a lot of us will have bought and back things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in the space, how we can make physical physics so that we can be able to do it, and <unk>
How would a future look like?
At the MIT Media Lab with my <unk> Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator, <unk> Post, we created this single physical pixel one.
This imam <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer like users can move the object anywhere inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did is we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of levitation and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, we released it from the restrictions of the time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay forever in the physical world.
You can teach physically <unk> and distance and the famous shot by Michael Jordan, can be reproduce as a physical reality that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts as the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or the text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what is most fascinating than changing the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something that will begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without we have to get ourselves in our world.
So we started the talk today about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that remains is our imagination.
Thank you.
And I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to <unk> a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed strongly that there was only a way that was accurate towards <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter if I work or not.
But my dream was to be an American opera singer,
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the shot of a radio show.
But no adult would tell you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much bigger to train.
My dream is never <unk>
I think for the rest of my life a second class of second class was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
<unk> to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I read about here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about life <unk>
And it is not <unk> <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> guilt and to <unk> the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture also led to my habit of reading <unk>
It takes a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map that I thought was out of place because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There is to research fields like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if I was reading comparative reading work for research, why not do it as well as life as well.
So I started reading books.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual and spiritual ones.
For the Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it is through the translation that I realized that Chinese <unk> literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to be used or <unk>
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that I'm not the only purpose of a dream.
The most important purpose is to connect with the place that dreams, where the dreams comes from, where the passion comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it is thanks to books, that I'm here, happy to be able to deal with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer of <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> I threw myself on the couch of my office and he took her shoes and told me he wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> <unk>
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories, that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy to move the head as it would take the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start to work after that, and then you get home later, it has children later, to death later.
As Alex as Alex and I had time to eat.
But shortly afterwards, my <unk> pushed me pushed to Alex to press Alex to talk about her life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, he's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like he was married with him."
And then my <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it's <unk> on the next.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage, is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel the head after what they were told, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex and a pause in its development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of benign handling was a real problem and it had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that nobody gets to adulthood without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take your dream a <unk> I want to see. It's okay.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be going to be 35 years old.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and experiences and moments that shape their life will have happened to when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> people over 40, not <unk>
This audience is going to be well, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner to 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and it gets <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change <unk> now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality.
<unk> are the moment to <unk> their body and your choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the time of <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> what defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to get big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not true?
What do you think about when you give a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
It's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it is absolutely nothing.
And then all of the days of smart, intelligent <unk> like you or children come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not <unk> I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I'm going to start a race before the 30, all be right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I was better at the day I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it turned out the music and everybody started to sit on it.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but it doesn't make the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure to the 30 and so many of them start a career, choose a city, choose a partner, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there's research that they start to show, which is a lot more difficult and stressful <unk> doing everything from once to <unk>
<unk> crisis is not about buying a red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want to do now.
<unk> tells you that you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give him a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having a crisis of identity.
He said that I'd like to work in art or the entertainment, but I still couldn't be able to decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a very difficult time, the previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often in our <unk> but then she was getting out of her to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent the entire morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the <unk> case, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who are going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care if I give you <unk>
At that moment, it took a lot of work to resist and I wouldn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> which was actually <unk>
He needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the decade <unk> of Emma <unk>
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that the crisis of identity and <unk> of identity.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generates capital capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try to.
Now I'm not <unk> the exploration exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that I shouldn't tell -- that, by the way, it's not exploration.
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and to make them count.
Secondly, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds just limit when you know how you think about how you think, how you talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who is going to come out almost always comes from its nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call the weak links friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half -- no, and the weak links are the way we get to this group.
Half of the work that we had never been <unk> then meeting the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published yet.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how the information is happening.
For the end, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose his family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> It was soon <unk> to her family, when he has a couple and a partner in his own family.
I told Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better enough to sit down than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But pick up the person who you live now or let me tell you now when all on Facebook start walking towards the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being so intentional in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or kill time with anyone who's going to get them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate of a cousin who was working on a art museum in another state.
This weak bond, helped him get a job there.
That work of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who live alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I sent to a letter that said, "Now the emergency contacts spaces are not <unk> enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming out of the airport from Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight fits in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, the 21 or the age of 25 and even <unk> a good time, a good TED talk can have huge effects over the next or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I have the privilege of saying to <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity, get an identity capital, and use their weak bonds -- choose your family.
They don't define why they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job consulting on a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics in seventh <unk> public schools.
And as any teacher, making tests and test tests.
I give them tasks.
When I work it would go, <unk> grades.
What I called attention was, <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones that had a better performance didn't have <unk> I.Q. <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for enough time.
After many years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure it differently.
It's the <unk> but what if you successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study, my question was, who do you succeed here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what they are going to do in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children were going to do as far as possible in the competition.
We studied teachers who are working in really hard neighborhoods -- <unk> what teachers will still be teaching for the end of the year and of <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the outcomes of learning their <unk>
We teamed up with private companies, what about these vendors are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all of those very different contexts, arose a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it was not social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my making, and then I waited about more than a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination they had significantly higher than <unk> even though they were <unk> on each of them that I could measure, things like family income, the results of <unk> testing, even the safety of the children when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where the <unk> matters is also in school, especially for the children of <unk>
To me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know the science of the developing thing.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you development the determination for children?
What do I have to do to teach children a solid ethic of work?
How do we keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent is not <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who are just not going ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination commonly is not related or related to backwards tests.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when the kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to start to start all again with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as a daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape of the Chinese characters.
So from that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreign level, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and easy way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic sustainability.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature enough enough to read traffic signals <unk> menus to understand the basic idea of pages or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as possible until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to give a walk.
<unk>
If the shape of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I were screaming in a way -- <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> from the form of called, but I like to believe it is the other way. The one that will work.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The door symbol looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are crowd.
If a person stretch out your arms, this person is saying, <unk> this <unk>
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a board under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a single speaker is quite an idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two two-digit together, it's very hot.
Three fireworks together, that are many flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon <unk> together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out about the horizon.
One door. You take a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> got someone at home?
This person is coming out on a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together are <unk>
Three women together, keep care about <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every little effort, they'll be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters that are the same as a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land.
This is a sun put together with the origin, because Japan is to this one of China.
So one sun next to the origin, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
One Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains lying over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, this has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where to come out is a <unk>
This is a slide for remind me that I should stop talking and go off the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the films I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Oz of Oz together.
The movie <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand, and you know.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of an industrial complex show of particular fantasy shows.
However, the Oz magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took up for 40 years later on, interestingly, another film whose name was a little <unk> and a <unk> kid <unk> a girl dressed as a <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the aid magician, do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz like the prophecy.
<unk> magic shoes to defeat the military generated by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing of the Oz magician is that the <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I did "Star "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I had a son as well.
Just three years.
I was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the oversight level had been <unk>  And so slid in the room and he was very impressed like a leg leg with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
I would have a sense that Luke joined an army to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the <unk> Oz <unk>
How do Dorothy for the movie?
They do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up <unk> right?
Why is there so much capital force rings in the movies for our children, and so little on the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first last couple really expected to be able to come up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on defeat the <unk> and get your reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney to anybody of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though them, they're not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job to teach girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids about the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of every time is still going on appearing in classical and <unk> each of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, it finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's available in shops.
Do you remember what the critical thing said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let me get that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happens the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's not very <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book -- and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of mine on the assessment of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There's only three questions that must be <unk> In the movie, there's more than a female character that has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk about each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more than the boy than you like?  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things to each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good movie, <unk>
Right? <unk> from <unk> success -- a consensus idea of what is a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen the test of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the crisis of the <unk>
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 most popular films how many of them believe they have actors <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a larger number that this is going to look like this room.
Last year, The New York Times ran a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
In the United States, one of five women says it has been sexually sexually in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children to have something to do with it.
Nor do I believe that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistician, one of the things that I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do they not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very elaborate statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools for our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that we will do, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mostly the parents.
I think we have to show our kids a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is changing radically.
You'll have read about how new economy is changing the role of home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter, what was his favorite character of "Star <unk> Do you know what he meant.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do they have in common?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
And I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help us to reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where I say to my <unk> <unk> and fight only and more stories where it looks like their work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people improve and be better people, like the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine, and one of the things that I liked was to look for sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're <unk> and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was going to get <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the archeology.
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that to do with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles of length along the <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to do a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different the <unk> look like.
This is a place located in the east <unk> of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in simple sight, seems to be brown but when we use infrared and process using fake, suddenly the place looks like <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used the satellite data to find an old city of old <unk> called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for over 400 years of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient arts and architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is large, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles away.
Before, the Nile Highway <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, it moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find find the random equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this is slightly more interesting area that you see inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs, you can see it here.
When I say <unk> is like you take them off in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we are looking for layers of causing human occupation to it.
So five feet down, below a very thick <unk> layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of objects of ceramics.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation of a number of hundreds of years that date the Middle Empire exactly the same period as we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> works of <unk> <unk> <unk> which proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that came back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a jewelry workshop who shows that what has been there, it was a very important city.
We still didn't find <unk> here, but we would go back to the place in a nearby future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the most <unk>
There's nothing like that on land.
So according to it as TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually started in 1984 City, C. <unk> in a lost city not for a long time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the pursuit of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing out in front of the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, and the material that it's made.
Now we would take a group of obese obese in bicycles.
They're competing in a <unk> race race and go in direction to their <unk>
I need to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of your house.
There is bicycles flying everywhere, wheels that goes on to the side of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the door, <unk>
By the lobby, to the hall, or what is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that I are talking about.
You can feel your blue <unk> going to tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you go to the point of getting into your mouth.
They go through a side and enter your living room.
It's already in the room, and making Britney <unk> of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing on the center, singing <unk> I was <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's get to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow block road and from the oven, comes to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
All right. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of these different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were looking at hundreds of numbers of numbers -- look at them just once.
They were looking at the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
We had entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who I could memorize more quickly the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be the phenomena of nature.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and it has one of the best memories <unk>
I said, "You know, when you realized when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I am not a wise.
I actually have a average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
We said, "We have been trained to perform these miraculous miracle acts of memory using some old <unk> and a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques I used <unk> to memorize the <unk> and that the <unk> academics used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How is it that I hadn't heard this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English -- although a little <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how you memorize the order in a deck of cards live, in national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not <unk>
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the year next year, not only training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of interesting people really interesting.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very likely to the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remembered it had a problem of <unk> is amazing.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> In he based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We went back to the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And on the back, I read a lot of treaties on the memory of writing something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having memory and disciplined memory and <unk> was not a thing as rare as it can be today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed the cognitive world.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this kind of competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there is a <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a team of researchers at University College London invited a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to be brains in some form of structural shape or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was no really interesting difference and meaningful difference between the brains of memory champions and the control of the control of control with the <unk>
When they put them on a <unk> MRI machine, you would take their brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or seemed to <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive is shifting as a armed race race where each year has come up with someone with a new way to remember more things, and then the rest of the competitors must be <unk>
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times of memory.
In his desk, in the front of it, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who is about trying to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he was just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there's a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used by the end of the end is just reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox <unk> <unk> says the following: I tell two people who remember the same word -- I tell them to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's her <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I return later on, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker and it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It has no relationship.
With all the other memories I dance on their head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> on your hands.
<unk> when they come back home to work.
You probably have some <unk>
And when I got that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is a half thousand years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is like this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had hired it as entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give you a very good party, they didn't get to a <unk> he would get <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up -- <unk> his poem from memory, and it was <unk> and so soon it was, the room of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> all of us.
But not only killed them all, but it shattered the bodies <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they couldn't afford them <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
They were standing out there, only surviving in the middle of the rubble, closed his eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single day.
I took the relatives of the hand <unk> where their loved ones were on the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we are not good at remembering names or numbers of phone or a word or a word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and a remarkable space memory and a remarkable spatial memory.
If you asked them to tell me the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to tell you who was sitting on the horse sign horse in your lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> from images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the earliest memory of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it memory, the same way that would have done it <unk> if they had been invited to <unk> it was 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're in the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy crazy image to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that reminded you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then you get in the kitchen, and the fourth subject that they would talk would be that strange journey that did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how <unk> <unk> <unk> their speeches -- not word for word, which is going to confuse but, typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek Greek -- which means <unk>
It's a breath when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got away from full of that.
I went to some of these memory, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an <unk> event.
So seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put me in your place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school department bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was a funny <unk>
I would never expect it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is better and better the ability to create and imagine these images, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> on the eye of the mind.
I was very hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard team of training for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some of the safety of safety covered with tape with just two <unk> because the displays is the worst enemy of a competitor of memory.
And I ended up coming back at the same competition that had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could <unk> in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve as good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone numbers, and it is actually this <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are just a little tricks. Get working.
Because they are based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of memory, these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It makes some kind of deep processing, a complete kind of attention that most of them are not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things get <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what <unk> the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence in the <unk> or the <unk> not to pay attention to the human being in front of us, who walks on our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even care about processing <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are amazing memory capacities for all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person you remember remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex subject, so we would <unk> just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am a <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I was living in my parents' house in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom who shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there they all spent the time watching TV. So every time I went from my room to the bathroom, I would all look at me, and every time I went back and wrapped up in a towel -- everyone looked at me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> and I hated it.
And I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
Right, here.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of areas, but of those connections that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel about that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
So architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want to do, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know how to be based on a building built two two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that they use architects to create emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build museum museums in the 19th century.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is frightening.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments, always are afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, you have a <unk> it has this round thing, columns, which are red, which leaves <unk> what <unk> is to communicate with this <unk> the children, the ownership values -- history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, became another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of <unk>
On one side, the architects that constantly drives new technologies, new new solutions for today's life forms.
We were going to do it and we made it so far away from the people.
And all of the black, you know, we think we think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and go back to those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we started experimenting with <unk> and we started experimenting with the <unk> and over and over again. So we've done this in the last 300 years, of course in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago it was about the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with this <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Really really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the <unk> in the other direction.
We take those shapes that we know like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a <unk> and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we become a skyscraper that can be <unk> <unk> facts.
The shapes were <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all went through the commercial centers and we moved to the neighborhoods, and we moved to the slums, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be the <unk> or the French <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what's happening with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know all of you know, that this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects are frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with this <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols we now have new <unk> design techniques -- and we find ourselves with new <unk> some ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You get totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those <unk> moments when and <unk> and public and public and public and public were completely aware of a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction <unk>
The tourism, in Bilbao increased a half thousand when they finished the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild forms, wild and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media are <unk> around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new millennium country happened with other architects star.
He went to <unk> and what happened with these few architects of elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to go through the entire architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about it, for example, how you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have been walking to the next town to see a building.
So shipping is <unk> you can take a boat, a plane, they can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, all of us are photographers in architecture, and the building is carried beyond the physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast, it's moving.
It doesn't happen a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings -- before I knew if the fact that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two years old, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we didn't have any idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen, because we're on the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, it begins to swing faster and faster, until they are on both extremes of it, almost in <unk> and indeed the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a holiday community.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly the product that was done, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to reach and share it in the social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that one made of the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and in order to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built today, first of us would come to the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, about what a library can be a library.
That is <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell you that there are no answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom of experience.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complex drawings and one is no longer a <unk> public that doesn't embrace something that has never seen before.
architects can listen, and you are not allowed to spread through the architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> of a style to another, of a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the old city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the extent of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick with the ideas of what it must be a <unk>
So this means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings <unk> the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make sports or to <unk> or even one can marry at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East <unk> in New York City, and raising half a million dollars of the community connected around that cause, is no longer a customer alone.
It means that any building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> so <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we've built.
architects already know how to make buildings more intelligent, smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for you to all of you.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give it a way to the <unk> spaces of local libraries -- the homes where we formed our children, and the New York <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he already started walking.
And it does this really great, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves those big <unk> <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to be able to think, When do I get to do this?
How is it that we are suddenly not comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for the Google: "I am <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and she lives in <unk>
And as any teenager wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, despite his mom tell him all the time she's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
And the mom tells him and what his friends, or fellow from the school said, "You don't know who I believe.
So a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and begs others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received more than 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a <unk> teenager and <unk> that gets these answers in one of the stages of their most vulnerable life emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is bringing them to do this?
Well, teens today almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, speaking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected in a continuous basis, so they were so young.
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And social pressures on the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected, it's forcing our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they get.
There are no division between a life in line and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is able to treat digitally.
What is the most important thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the girls right now.
<unk> <unk> remain <unk> our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what young people are for?
But kids are not immune to this.
It's like the superheroes superheroes in sports and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we surely want our children to grow healthy and be good individuals and they're <unk>
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls prefer to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for growth as human beings and like <unk> to society and working development.
31 percent, almost one every three teenagers are not interested in the debates of the classroom to participate in the classroom in the classroom because they don't want to call attention to their physical form.
One of each five are not attending at all of the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the rainy season, if you don't think you are good enough -- specifically if you don't think you're bad enough -- <unk> a note at the average of the average of your fellow fellow who don't care about it as appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, U.S. and China.
And it turns out regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be good of course, we are talking about how you can see you not how you really are.
The low self-esteem of your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk>
The teenagers with a little self-esteem do do less physical activity, eating less fruit and vegetables, participate in more diets not healthy that can take you to a food meal.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's all about all of this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol and drugs, diet involves aesthetics, aesthetics, sex with early ages and without protection and <unk> damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel secure with the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would it be that countries?
And so we would make this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't just take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first one is that we have to instill in trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very impressed by when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow not only will have a positive impact but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas, the first one is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
So these six aspects are very important starting points for anyone willing to provide a education in terms of body self-esteem to work.
An education is important, but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take goals into the issue, and let's be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
We challenging the current status of such as women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians on <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of the <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start by judge people for what they are, not as you see.
All of us can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can get people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, and governments and as businesses, to change our culture, for our children to grow up to be valuing their entire person to spend the individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people who really make the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make it be those who come out on the big screen because we will only create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never going to be able to be seen by being those who are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are in your mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two seats away, what it would mean for her if he was liberated from that <unk> voice, which would be told by not having a long legs -- <unk> more <unk> a more flat belly feet -- <unk> feet.
What would it mean for her if we were able to do this, and we would be able to liberate his potential.
Right now, the obsession with our culture with images are now attached to us.
But <unk> our children the truth.
And the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
It will help the self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of today, they will become agents of personal change agents in their morning.
Let's do it.
The five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the <unk> <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense <unk>
In fact, initially he was able to say, "Hey, but being prisoner by other juvenile charges in the company in others, they started planning from attacks at about 12 icons in New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily, those plans were <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the 1993 bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't be done.
Later it would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a <unk> mother teacher -- the first two of them did all the possible for giving me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam that very few, including most Muslims come to know.
I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all human group, there is always a small fraction of people who were going to get together so <unk> their convictions that thinks that we have to use all the possible means that everybody lived as well.
A few months before the arrest he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends, he and some friends, had been going to break off in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> that without knowing our group -- I was <unk> by the FBI.
When I played my father <unk> my father helped me hold my father on the shoulder and explained how to point to the goal for about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that <unk> gave him the little orange light on the target and to surprise you, especially me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
From such a father, as a child.
And all of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter, but only a few years later I understood what they looked so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a <unk> with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved through 20 times, and that instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone already was time to pack up and go to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class that was often the victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white thing, but it will be the new of the class, silent class, it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have social skills, to put it <unk> to grow under <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
They were <unk> opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in the test, was during the presidential election of 2000.
In a <unk> program, where I participated in the <unk> National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been a victim of <unk> most of my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found that one of the kids who had done, I was a Jewish guy.
I took several days out to the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud of having been able to overcome the barrier that all of the life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush -- a park of <unk>
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All of the life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I was able to see that several of them were the <unk> and less critical that I had seen in life.
Having been a kid, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of each other but it wasn't easy for me to treat <unk> in exactly the way as I wish to be treated.
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is to be a homosexual but I know what is going to be <unk> by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every evening, Jon Stewart made me being honest with my <unk> and I helped to see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, don't have anything to do with character.
In many ways, he turned my figure out, at a time when I was desperately <unk>
In occasions, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the <unk> eyes of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all of that hatred inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why decided I decided to go out and put myself into a risk?
Well, it's easy.
I've done it because I hope that someone else is going to be able to bring to violence, you can hear my story and understand that there is a better way that even though I gave myself to this violent ideology of violent and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against <unk>
I do it because of the victims of terrorism and their loved pain -- the terrible pain and the loss that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak against those acts of meaningless acts as rejection of my father.
So with this picture, I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to no religion or race, that children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
At this point there is a movie that projects in their minds.
It's an amazing <unk> film.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your movie has <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as a moments of your childhood that project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience all of them directly.
This film is your <unk> the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have a real internal movie, you, you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least I know I have a personal awareness.
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason for living.
If we were not aware of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we're going to have to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible to be a science of consciousness.
And science, by nature, is objective to be objective is objective is objective is objective is objective <unk>
<unk> by nature, is subjective <unk>
Then you can never have a science of consciousness.
Because over the course of almost the 20th century, <unk> that vision.
And psychology was studying <unk> behavior, and the neuroscience is studying the <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to do the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limits to the moment.
The center of consciousness science in recent years was the search for <unk> correlations among some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds a few questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain are and what they want to do with.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
There's actually no problem with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real mystery mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why does a movie <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how they operate the <unk> how they are <unk> how they're <unk> and <unk> living organisms -- all of these are questions about how it works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a phenomenon -- how we <unk> how we speak, how we play <unk> are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why all of this is that all behavior is accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, doesn't actually have a lot to say.
I am an opinion scientist from heart.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was hitting my head against a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to tell us at this point.
We have a wonderful chain of unintended explanations -- we get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think that consciousness is right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate in our view of the world, but we don't even know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need to need ideas that at the beginning, crazy things before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for these crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such a hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the inner subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what we need to do, is to explain the functions of <unk> the brain behaviors and this is what everything needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> awareness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to just deny that the observation of consciousness is reversed.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time we left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and fundamental properties is not to explain in terms of the most basic things.
On the contrary, they look at fundamental principles, and it is built the world.
Sometimes the fundamental list is <unk>
In the 19th century, it discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of fundamental concepts -- time, <unk> laws of Newton. And then I applied the basic laws of the <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, <unk> space, time, <unk> <unk> then for a matter of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The natural thing would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that govern consciousness that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass, the physical processes.
Now, physicists are sometimes saying that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everyone, and every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, dogs, flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when they think -- I would always go traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some element of <unk> <unk> <unk> some early <unk> of consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would someone think about something so <unk>
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and <unk> is natural to assume that it can also be universal.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way to find fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing.
<unk> of complex <unk> like a human <unk>
<unk> of simple information, simple information.
Something really exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And I think <unk> has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration -- a high degree of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a kind of medium integration of information, just as significant, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the [unclear], microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different awareness level of zero.
In fact that a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness into the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the reality behind us.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire come from?
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be held as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything to have consciousness, so I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll have a lot hungry.
I think I think, well, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
It has a complicated view of information -- she has a complicated processing processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a pretty serious ethical problem on the ethic of developing computer systems and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the collective collective consciousness on the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group of course, as the audience at a TED talk -- right now we have a collective collective consciousness -- an inner movie for this entire TED group, different from the silent movies on each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that you must take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer at the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second thing is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way towards a serious consciousness theory.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we finally will find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small village in rural Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a low profile of education.
I went to school, I went to my friends, I was <unk> with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to have a <unk> for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is a evident.
She's actually not <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of the teaching in a high school school, so only for about 20 minutes in the middle of 11 minutes in the middle of 11 minutes -- a guy raised the hand and said, "Hey, when to give you your <unk>
And I said, "What is <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> <unk>
When people at chairs. They talk about <unk> things in school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people as an inspiration.
And we don't. And it's not the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there for inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair -- and you probably are waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they've lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is a <unk> A cap -- capital <unk>
It's a bad thing to live with a disability and live with an disability, makes you fantastic it.
It's not a bad thing and it doesn't make you <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk> <unk>
Or is this <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl without the little baby drawing with a pen held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with <unk> <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn term <unk> because we will give a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will encourage the disabled people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and say, "Well, it's very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that guy.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that they've been dealing with strange <unk> to express that they believe that I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I got up to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attached to people with disability to people with no disability.
They're there for you to see you and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
Let's get some things.
But the things we overcome are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was called the social model of disabilities, which tells us that we're more disabled because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
The things I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies taking the best of their capacity.
So it's really just <unk> in the way that we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people tell us, "You are a source of <unk> it tells you how a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh my God, you're not going to be inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't think I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to load your mobile phone on your chair.
Great.
And we learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and we're going to be <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have been sold to us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles before a leg leg has never done to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a television screen, I'm not going to show up the <unk> for the <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to actually live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> doesn't be considered to not be considered to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we'll be <unk> by getting out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the real achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child of 11 degree in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and the professional football with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'll just respond to one of those questions, so I'm not <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you are going to do with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is running through the game of game to 160 <unk> blood hitting the ears.
We can know it feels like a man of 110 pounds of 110 pounds -- trying to <unk> it with all its being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
I think of some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the helmet, give you an idea of it.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the <unk> practices because the idea of the emerging technology of technology is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A few times -- a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue <unk> Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling of being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get from <unk> how we took it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many of you know about.
The Rift Valley has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, nice.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a Russian mountain <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan.
When I could be <unk> running through the <unk> they put the ball into the back of the network?  Or you would make a stick on <unk>
What is your experience when you <unk> from a mountain to more than 100 miles like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it's <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this is not actually <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we reach the reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> reality when <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it for <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a quick pause on the technology in <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> had a <unk> to his <unk> of the field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radii on the <unk> of the <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you're a player coming back to your group and you see your next big amount of plastic in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that takes <unk> you don't have to worry about to forget a <unk>
or memorize the strategy.
Just go into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate <unk>
If you lose games as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How would you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium, having a view from the top of the people that are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
Bad information will be <unk>
So this is going to be the good teams of the bad equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being just <unk>
It would be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
He would make the ball and <unk>
You get to a open receptor. All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left part of your bombsight -- you will tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> you don't know it, but the <unk> system will be <unk>
They put into the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> that there's a open receptor.
<unk> the <unk> but you get <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where we land. But the receptor sees its bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and you can change the race.
<unk> takes the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have been followed by each angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion, in the game.
So I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of <unk> reality.
We're going to use it just as a bread and <unk> like our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings to show someone how to literally be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk> <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is it worth this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives to be <unk>
How much is it also worth for a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face and the challenges that we face, <unk> as usual.
Thank you.
I was recently told after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years I spent the <unk> end of the South County <unk> which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known by their beautiful views of San Francisco, the Ocean Pacific <unk> and its very architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who engineer who would build the bridge, said that "The bridge is pretty much to test <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and practical or <unk>
But from its openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of you think that traveling between the two towers will bring it to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, such as it frees you out of all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body hits about about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bones, some of which we have vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that no, it usually <unk> in the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that <unk> this method of suicide will be aware of the <unk> death that they <unk>
This is cable wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people have been before they had their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its darkest time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year as this young man spoke with a guy looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had successful that day to bring back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
We were able to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who <unk> suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, medical officers and psychologists train the new official today.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at 22 o'clock in Julius last year when I got a call from a single suicide subject -- sitting in the verge near the center.
<unk> and when I arrived, I looked at Jason talking with a bridge of the Golden Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and there was flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, there were actually flown up here two times before New Jersey to try to kill suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could get more than <unk> and she opened the box.
He came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked me, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
They stopped a little bit of <unk> leaned on the right, and it was.
This kind and clever guy in New Jersey had just taken up with life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the mother of the family called me to see what she was.
The parents of Jason had had their <unk>
<unk> damage affects a lot of people.
Let me ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What did you find?
<unk> what is that?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you have to listen to.
You can hear to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or say to the person who you know how it feels because they probably didn't know it.
Just being the inflection point that they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask them the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life, you've had these <unk>
They go to the person in front of it can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do with <unk> social isolation and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son the 19 of January of this year, and he wrote to me this email just a couple of days, and it's with his permission and blessing I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home and talk to your friends that tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike didn't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the thylacine party with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and they were <unk> as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the foreign car was down the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> in the late day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who has not been wrong without having a real mental illness.
It must not be so easy to finish it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a ticket through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man when I mean hope and value.
On March 11th of 2005, I wrote to a radio call for a possible subject of the bridge of the bridge near the north.
<unk> my motorcycle on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> foot on the sidewalk.
When he saw, he immediately crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the hour and a half later, I heard as Kevin spoke about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided for his account that day to go back over that lane and give the life another opportunity.
When Kevin turned out to him.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he did, and gave him the hope and the life of the other <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I am <unk>
They stopped me to speak and simply <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that card with me, and I would like to give you <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing <unk> <unk> <unk> and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness, which has been properly <unk>
I was going to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits <unk> but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, as the say.
We give God for you.
I really wanted to debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she writes <unk> When I visited at the National San Francisco Hospital that night, you will be able to get the patient.
I mean, I did have to do it.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather had poison.
That act, even though I finished his own pain, they theft, the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, you wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want your own chest pain.
Usually this is only about three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and phone calls around the bridge.
From those incidents where I've been directly involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I was <unk> at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we came up to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one of those people who leave the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us must be working on to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question is, how do you get in that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside was finally <unk> with my inner truth.
For complicated reasons, what I'm going to do later on, when I look at this photo, I'm going to get it, you kept it <unk>
But last October, I discovered that I was beginning.
We all love our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs of those who surround us.
They are people who are always challenging the status quo -- what's considered to <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent even, I ignored my story.
I think this puzzle.
This is mine.
They recorded me as <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, and I always carried this t-shirt into the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why would you always take that t-shirt into the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender always has been considered a <unk> but now we know that in truth, it's more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I never helped me to share my story, not because I thought to be a bad thing, but how do the world treat those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate being woman.
I have a mama, Dad and a family who <unk> me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
Is there a <unk> goddess of the <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember this beautiful woman came in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me, this is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15, when he was still wearing a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the CEO of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why don't you ever participate in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if you got to her, she was responsible for the overhead <unk> and <unk> and that night, he won in the bathroom, won in <unk> and he was a third finalist between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first work was to Queen of beauty of women, <unk> but I can.
I also met the goddess of the <unk> especially when <unk> <unk> the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom who had moved to San Francisco, I called me and I told me that I passed my request from the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "Do you know that if you give you the U.S. you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I would put it on to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was born in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand to do the most sophisticated and sophisticated surgeries and secure.
Back then, in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and the <unk> of gender <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity is to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was my license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and being model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman from New York who was living in his truth, but that <unk> actually put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
And all 20 November, we do a global <unk> for the <unk> Day, <unk>
I'm on this scenario thanks to a long history of people who are <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, at the same moment, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and only for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday I have no longer <unk> of <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. First of all, thank you for all my <unk>
To my support network, my parents especially, my family, who is very strong.
And I remember all the times I've been to young people who have been <unk> who I have <unk> and some times, when I was called, and they told me that his parents couldn't read it, and I took my mom and he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- other things don't. It's just identity identity, that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table of the theme that sometimes that task is not block, and there should be a space that would allow people to say, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very kind. <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> and tribal societies to the parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by education defending their rights in 2007. And when their efforts looked at their efforts in 2011, the National Prize <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when I was born a girl, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome or his father or his mother.
On the neighborhood -- it gives their <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother was getting a lot of a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, you get sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the paralyzed mother, but the daughter, <unk> <unk> when it comes in, they suffer too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays home and the school admits of their siblings.
Until the age of 12 years, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, you have to get it out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family and his family, and if you were able to get the code of that of course honor, I could even kill.
And it's interesting that this kind of code of honor, doesn't only affect the life of a <unk> also affects the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and the happiness of their sisters in the name of the American course.
And there's one more rule of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and it accepts the decisions of their father and mother and the decisions of the old people, even if you don't want it.
If you call it with a man who doesn't like it, or the <unk> with an old man, he has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk> of <unk>
If you were very young, it has to accept it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to her daughter, and the same lesson to his kids.
And this vicious cycle goes on and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was <unk> I thought of her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she died, when she was four and a half years old and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half years -- in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yes, I should <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, is a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
One path to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspiration where it can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and no one of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when you <unk> the form of a Canadian <unk> and I was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for the value to my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or their daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I would sit down with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to <unk> it in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all of these good values in my school to girls and boys as well.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for the rights of women.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of the participation of women in all of our economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got up in the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the birthday of the BBC, he offered her himself for the documentaries of the New York Times, and I talked about every platform I could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and nine in October 2012, was shot in the head of the head.
It was one day for my family and for me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he <unk> him to my wife -- "I've got to <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And he said, "Please, please don't get <unk>
<unk> the <unk>
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words would be a lot to me, and I didn't get back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe headaches from head because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was attached by the face of my wife.
But my daughter was never <unk>
I used to be <unk> "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to get right. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we got <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist in the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any age of 16 years.
<unk> when it's not just his task.
You fight their siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What are there special in my <unk> that has done so audacious to <unk> and so brave and <unk>
I say, I'm not wondering what I did.
<unk> what I did.
I didn't cut his wings, and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I am engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I have joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> -- the <unk> of Google X-ray -- but all the work that I talk about today about the science of the brain, I made it before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation as well.
Are you still just like intelligent or not?
Is it not going to be like that, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what a number of doing more than about a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to get it to live with life.
More than I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would be able to get the <unk> doses because there really doesn't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to test a different <unk> and I was shocked by seeing how small changes in the dose -- dramatically my <unk> my sense of who was me, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a typical dose and a typical chemical <unk> for a man from 1900s, and I was blown away by seeing how I saw my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several types of things, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a very <unk> fixing a problem that had on the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So, I couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of the men and what they have to do -- since I am better at men.
What I was trying to do is that we would like to adjust those hormones and <unk> and so forth, it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking -- my ideas of ideas.
<unk> to think almost always in images, and that became my key reference point how I can get those mental imagery that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you are <unk> and new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things in the same way.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental imagery are fundamental to the thought and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really, really sophisticated mental <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use your imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain <unk> systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two recent experiments that were done by two groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology image on functional MRI, to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person who looks at an image.
The column of the middle shows the brain scan of that same individual as they were <unk> seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between looking at an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were tracking their brains to create a big set of reactions of the brain in front of the video.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new animals, and as long as we were getting a new <unk>
The computer using only the <unk> brain information -- to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This gave us <unk>
We're okay to do this.
We just need to make the resolution.
And now, remember when you see an image and when you imagine that same picture, you create the same <unk>
This led to the largest <unk> systems that are available today, and their resolution was a lot of a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we <unk>
There are many techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't give that one.
A lot of them are proposing new techniques of projection by images, even I think of it with the recent result of the MRI -- first we need to ask the next one, this technology will be the end of the way.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get more resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets only provides small improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands like we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger magnets -- make better magnets.
We can create structures that are much more complex than a little bit different, like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI was to make really big magnets -- right?
However, most of the recent developments in <unk> and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the poo and immediate radio frequency in the MRI systems.
At their time, instead of a magnetic field -- <unk> magnetic patterns -- <unk> the frequencies of <unk> radius.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of radio processing processing patterns, we can actually increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide in layers our growing knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even neural neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas in direct the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do you learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is big.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> to use as a tool to amplify our skills and communication skills.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more options more than opening up this door.
Anyway, choose one year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet maybe to tell some person for the first time that loves love or tell someone to be pregnant, or tell someone to have cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have to pass through in life.
And so I spend this hard conversation and although our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working on the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through a few stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> and <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And it will be slope by the <unk> of my pants <unk> and I had a head of my head -- I would usually ask myself a kid -- "Hey, you are a kid or <unk>
And he would appear with uncomfortable silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> on it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a kid between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised me that the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time I was ready and I was about to get out of the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
Gloria <unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues,"
So I took a deep breath down, and I went down the eyes and my backs was a little girl, and looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "Are you a kid or <unk>
So I took a breath back again, and I stood up with it close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is kind of messy.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw clothing clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I am more than the kind of girl in a <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite colleagues is <unk> and he's got a fish.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the hard conversation that I ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, I was often my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you 100 reasons why to come out of my closet it was harder than getting out of his, but this is the <unk> -- the hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who has declared in banking <unk> is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more difficult than saying to your five year-old <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop setting out what is hard for us to be difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
In some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what their walls are, a <unk> is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse <unk> a dress and <unk> shoes.
He was not the militant lesbian equipped to fight any child in four years that would fit in the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark <unk> <unk> my <unk> gay, and the move only a muscle is the most scary thing ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers who I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was going back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't spears that <unk> I'll kill you.
One of my more memorable launches was at my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and when I got my <unk> lady <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known to do so.
And after speaking a moment, one of the women cried <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is we have friends in St. Petersburg.
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program, Will and Grace will.
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but at waiting to show desperately his support, to get me to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is using shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that we <unk>
It's like that hard conversations are still going to be my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but you understand that what it involves coming out of any breakthrough is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> the <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the cafe didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others have to know that we are to suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  giving the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It will never be done by that.
And some of them can be injured safe, <unk> for what they've done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not about you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark <unk> <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And it may be very good, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen the intelligence -- a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> which "The question might think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical trial to the computer pioneers as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, <unk> a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
So let's step back.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth and the <unk> of Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can look at Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it has no concept about the Earth -- they would be forced to develop a physics theory that explained how to some point in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet, stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question that we understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately accurately for the development of intelligence, and in particular, to development of universal states that will make the diversity of the future possible future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize complex freedom in order to make complex tasks.
And so, taking all of these different issues and we would push them together, and I asked them for a number of years ago, there's a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only a equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of one E = <unk> for intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're looking at here is a statement that intelligence is a force, which is a force -- that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a force T, with the diversity of possible future, accessible, yeah, up to an imminent time, <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom and maintain the options.
And so, if you realize this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, I'll show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has been suggested that the universes that produce more value, or <unk> during their life should be more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not just correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually it comes directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in any system where you find it.
<unk> <unk> could go through multiple animal testing, play games of humans, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without it that would have been done.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided to figure out the <unk>
This skill skill will have applications for humanoid robotics, and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Furthermore, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing them up on the opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of the model of that task.
This ability to cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly going to be constantly <unk> and it keeps the net well connected.
This is the same capacity for <unk> for health care -- energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> we organize the routes of a ships, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to extend to the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of <unk> <unk> in a simulated <unk> <unk> in their economic management.
This risk of risk management will have vast applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of human behaviors of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all of one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term <unk> the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if you had smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion of it.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion -- <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take the control of all possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, general intelligence can actually arise out directly from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
And so often they ask me, how is it that you search for goals to go through this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go through the descendants of helping them help build artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence -- is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the <unk> of the stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points out to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the intensity of the stars when the planets go through them in front of them, and you block a little bit of that light that we do.
The data collected by Kepler is showing the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their stem star.
And so together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that gets from their own.
At his time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this trove of potentially <unk> that are potentially <unk> our own planet.
The year 2014 was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us since millennia are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on global scale have rapidly <unk> our ability to alter its course.
But I'm not a climate scientist and the weather, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the health sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the pursuit of life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets similar to the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world that is shown by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and part of it, that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> as <unk> tracks its surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not just short space flights but also a chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images, <unk> remind us at the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry places and more <unk> on the Earth, the air is cool and full of oxygen, by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
And I worry about this excitement by the colonization, Mars and other planets and the <unk> and the belief that the implication is and the belief that we expect to expect out there to save us from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is that it's truly livable the Earth.
For a lot that I like <unk> exploration, I'm deep strongly with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be there for humanity is as a imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party will actually have place later in the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration.
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal to understand, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
Just that you find closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain space <unk> in the hostile and <unk> areas of the land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, having to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of year is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider to keep living between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that are producing this development.
It's arrogant to think that only international colonization, will save us from ourselves, but the <unk> <unk> and <unk> exploration.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on the Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window in the dining table, where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all right.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had a flight early in Europe to the next morning, and I was <unk> from my passport, and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but rather than not more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, well, despite the circumstances, room right now.
I'm a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who goes up your heart rate -- <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I came to the counter of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in your place, which would be bad things that would happen.
Or at least if you do bad things, you know, you know, the probability of it is a total catastrophe for it.
So I started to think about that, but to a month later my thoughts didn't happen.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing with something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what came wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you go ahead and try to figure out all the things that might be wrong, then trying to figure out what it can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious ones.
In the house, we would take a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds of common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make track of the location of the important stuff, where the fine, where the fish are, where the fish are <unk> where the male tribes live in and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that goes into the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not so good for things that are moving a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car keys and reading and <unk>
So in the house -- you know, a place for the keys, a hook alongside the door, maybe a <unk>
For your passport, a particular crate <unk>
For their glasses of reading, a particular <unk>
If you look at a place and they're <unk> with it your things always will be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card board license away from driving you to yourself for the <unk>
If these things lose or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or one of a dear thing, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all decision-making, and in fact to make it decision-making and social choices, any kind of decision that you need to take from that would benefit a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've received the <unk> lab, and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that helps you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you probably heard about the <unk> and it knows that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even you probably know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question you should do then, a statistic that you must ask for the most doctors don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think about what kind of <unk> statistic is <unk>
The number needs to be one.
My doctor would not give me something if it wasn't going to help me.
But actually, the medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it comes to somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We have not really understood <unk> mechanisms.
But <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think is it?
How many people have to take it before they can help one person?
300.
This is according to the research of the cynical researchers, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I do explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a single heart attack, stroke or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance on 300 to go down my <unk>
Why wasn't, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic and it is, <unk> of the effects <unk> Yes?
For this particular drug, the side effects is produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> things and muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they're thinking, <unk> five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress doesn't think clearly.
So think about how we do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that helps you help you.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I'm just saying that you must have this conversation with their physician.
The medical ethic is a part of the principle of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
So for the surgery that more is done in the older men of 50 percent of the prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
So it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or erectile <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of that 50 percent of the effects only <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can have to make up the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice too many times, they want a shorter life to pain, or a longer life that could have much pain in the end?
These are the things that speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change the opinion of the <unk> but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that point is that the whole bunch of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face the face with a predatory system, it doesn't need the system <unk> or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism on those things, don't react very quickly. You could get the lunch lunch so that none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational sense of rational thinking like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we need to be able to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail to time.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help minimize the harm, or to prevent things like bad things in the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination next to the door, with a key to the entry door in the same way, a easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite symbol of music.
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to be <unk>
Two <unk> <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be -- you would never have a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade, and over the time time it was mixed with local signs, and the language was developed with the language that we now know as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, it's like I lived in a foreign country -- following blind their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand sound?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my little <unk> and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example ...
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise at eating the bag of potato chips.
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure not <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is all called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sounds.
And I'm always waiting for the sound, the sound, which is coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
They are going to be able to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines contain the sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is the equivalent of sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines in the paper.
In 2008, we had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for a artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and <unk> spaces, and as I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
He's going to get more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that they don't only experience through your ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound ownership and <unk> in my art practice.
And everything that had taught me in sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> was a kind of <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could get it off.
I chose to make me angry.
There's a massive culture around talking language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me from equal to the same and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking <unk> his voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If we will not continue with this practice, I feel that I might be able to do it in the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new medium artistic medium -- <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't be catching and express in the paper.
And the same thing can be said from a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in many different <unk>
If you map a different <unk> for each finger while it hits the piano, like facial expression, the facial expression, the body movement, the speed, the shape of the hand and so while it hits the piano, the English is a linear language -- as if it's just going to just go to the same time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a clear concept or an idea of <unk>
If only one key to change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and it <unk>
This is all day."
If you go through it, and you get a visual speed, you see it as a piece of music.
It all day.
I feel that the same can be said of <unk> the <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to your body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> it's two hands, the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last thing that is my favorite and dramatic idea at the time -- I was going to get back again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at the same time."
Look at <unk> right, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and my chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I'm going to show you a way of the hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands in high hands.
Now we're going to do it both in the head like the chest sort of like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and signs across the world.
The second one I would like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please take it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job all.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and chest but they carry very different meanings of them.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> not that you have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a treasure trove of trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to open your ears, open your ears, to participate in our culture and experiment in our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance to say, because adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I found out that adults are also very good at cleaning up to clean people's people.
Time country, now I'm adult and teach the citizenship and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's a little bit creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big fires and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use those huge boats
So along with my students, six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> of work with <unk> for the kids to be very <unk> they can also participate.
And I will tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and reduce it to the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to focus on something that we hope to work.
So we decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the children would be a lot of the robots.
Then we quickly started what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in creating prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we turned off light bulbs and <unk> web cameras and <unk> it in a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see these plastic bits floating through the sensor while the computer on board will process this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get a clear estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would give you even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and you get <unk> with this picture.
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is where the water is where the place they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the mud and the oil is also brown color and when everything is <unk> it's very difficult to see what there is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can spread through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we shipped it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help in a remote form of other children.
And so I can investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, perhaps to address a harder problem, and also closest to me.
I'm a Japanese half and half the French and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that triggered several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> were <unk> by various cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power plant to the water.
And today, according to the reports on the average of 300 tons is still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean.
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, you seem to be most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast, and the majority of the time, it looks safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the crash, and research with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time, we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course not <unk> the parents don't have it.
But every night we <unk> at the center of <unk> here is the use of <unk>
It might seem like they didn't take the serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed the data that day, and we talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> shifted to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this we were able to notice that the radioactive dust <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But on the basis of this we organized a civil expedition the nearest to the nuclear power to date.
We're approaching a half miles of nuclear, and with the <unk> help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and we've built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem with a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work on these different scales of open-source and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should get the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of a small thing, and we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we convert it into the largest space dedicated to the environmental and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, -- basically, you can actually build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in mobility of the age of age, transforming their standard wheels in new self-driving vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizens scientists, creators, we need to prepare the next generation for the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite cultures.
One is made out of thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other one of one string of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One of the environment, the other thing I thought about it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure out to be free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we carry all the information that was needed for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the design world has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made out of <unk> <unk> the imagination of designers and architects to think about their objects as <unk> from different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One acts primarily as a filter, the other mostly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect in working today between the <unk> and the gene, between the assembly machine, and the gene, between Henry Ford and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analytics and Chinese, it shows in the two screens after me.
My work, in the simplest level, trying to bring these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and moving to growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where you have four disciplines that offer designers access to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scale, scale, like this robotic arm with a scope of 24 feet in diameter with a base of the day that someday not very far to print <unk> buildings, and graphics made from <unk> genetically <unk> <unk>
So here's the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every opening is a single size to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion parade of Paris with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made of one single piece, <unk> in the white <unk> around the waist.
Along with collaborator, 3D printing we print this layer and completely 3D <unk> without seams between the cells, and I'll show you more objects like that.
This hull combines <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this <unk> analytical <unk> and <unk> instruments that are able to design products that are <unk> not only the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a <unk> chair, a <unk> and comfortable chair, and it also absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator, came back to nature for <unk> and when I design this <unk> pattern, it becomes <unk>
And we had this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the points of pressure in the human body.
His surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not through the addition of the other material or another <unk> but <unk> continually <unk>
But it's the <unk> nature.
There's no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish house, but when I was a young man, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and really define a lot of what it matters.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God beat the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first <unk> tree there would be no difference between trunk, branches, and <unk> and <unk>
All the tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the earth did grow trees with branches, cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made out of place.
I often ask myself, "What would the design be if the objects were made of a single part?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we were looking for the material that would make the kind of material out of the <unk> tree with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million metric tons produced every year by organisms -- or maybe or or or <unk> <unk>
We think that if we could <unk> their properties, we could generate structures that are <unk> in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  We had a bunch of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk> <unk>
We had chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from the dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the <unk> structures built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of one material -- three long materials -- 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are <unk> it leaves them to be able to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of printing the printing process was used for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria engineered to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition from <unk> <unk> and if it <unk> even more, to windows.
A <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure of <unk> of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for <unk> in the sea, <unk> the <unk> life and placed in the ground, they will help grow a tree.
The fits for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to maintain life for <unk>
To do that, we need to dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> chart did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- it will be <unk> new biological sources within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these engineered crops.
In our first piece of clothes, you get two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human brain.
One makes light in sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, don't interact in nature.
In fact, it never gets <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution for design.
To hold these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the tract tract -- that will help us bring these bacteria and to make their function of way.
So we started growing those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to the <unk>
If we wanted to get more <unk> you get more transparent channels.
This is a <unk> <unk> system, when you stretch from one end to the other, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels with life inside your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are everyday middle creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would get the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that raise the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, and we make our skin tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way to edit the biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For it, you always have to go back to nature.
So for now, you know that a 3D printer print material <unk>
You also know that nature does not do this.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they were <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It does it through combination not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, by putting those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first becomes the environment, creates a <unk> structure and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a little magnet to the head of a <unk> <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the worm of silk.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that you would <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different backgrounds, different <unk> and we've figured out that the shape the composition, the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it uses in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape the <unk> silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put ourselves in our site.
We knew that silk silk worms we knew that the silk silk worms is that we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of the light and the heat -- the silk worms over structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
We asked these silk worms to a silk farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to get <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom edge of the <unk> and as they were <unk> <unk> they got eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the big integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> biological silk on the <unk> silk -- they give all this canopy into the integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, we <unk> silk worms <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk <unk>
The <unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
<unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new age of creation, that brings us from a design inspired by nature to an inspired nature of design, which demands of us, for the first time, that we do take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked you, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time that?
They can hold them with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question question: "What do you want to be <unk>
They caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had a <unk>
In the school I liked English, and the <unk> and the art and website and online websites, and it was also playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And usually I like to test and persist anyway, for having dedicated a long time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, that's no longer a challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I was fascinated by something else, something totally different, and I'm going to get it into it, and I let myself absorb and I feel <unk> I have found the <unk> and then again, this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give it to you.
But then I'd like to figure out something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to convert this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all of my other passions, and <unk> <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad in me for no <unk> at all.
I was worried to be afraid of commitment, or whether to be <unk> or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to ask you then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they did, they learned it from culture.
We asked the first question: "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would go to that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in the children like, <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is done over and again as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students, you ask them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by kids to dream with what they might be, is not inspired by dreaming of what they might be.
In fact, it does right the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, although adult adults might be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob Bob <unk>  And he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and to dedicate your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up their curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel it alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
It could help if you divide it into three <unk> <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms of <unk> the same idea, as <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was the ideal who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
It would make any term you like it or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a sort of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or woe you must win.
But what I've learned talking about people and writing about these ideas on my website, which is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields, and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in developing data, visualizing math and design, when I started <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk> <unk>
To <unk> and Rachel came up with a single idea of his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
The innovation happens at intersections.
From the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all its background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is the rapid learning.
When we <unk> we go into something, we're going to do it.
We look at all that we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means we have less fear of testing new things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we have learned that we rarely start zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and independent <unk>
As a young girl, <unk> an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I become a writer, <unk> was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when they started their voice, and this ability to write it through a compelling time for the editors.
I rarely have a loss of time to go to what you're going to tell you even if you end it down.
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is the adaptability. It is the ability to turn into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, each other, a web pages -- sometimes innocent pages of Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, it seemed to be James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take a lot of different <unk> depending on the needs of their customers.
<unk> <unk> Company defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to engage them to meet the market needs that actually <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three abilities that could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems -- we would take it right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart <unk>
<unk> the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive into depth and put ideas and have ideas, it provides a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are dealing with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, to <unk> in a large part of them are given to them as just as their fellow <unk>
And once I said that, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the internal wiring is what it is.
If you are a heart specialist, then you will go through all the media.
That's where you will give you the best one.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those of you who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
Let's get the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, we <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we had a woman named <unk> they took them to a psychiatric in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> it until that, unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If you had been living today, we could not give it more help that he <unk> it gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in getting a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've found antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from <unk> many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral cancer for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and so much more.
But it has been progress in the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm a part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think of this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million of you.
If you wait to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the probability that you spend their years with Alzheimer's or helping caring for a friend or want Alzheimer's disease.
In America, health care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spending in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their costs -- an increase in five times in 2050, by 2050, the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively unusual to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> to cure or even slow down their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer cancer cancer than Alzheimer's despite the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and cause a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, you know, all the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only a picture of a healthy brain that is a healthy brain compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to creating a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's percent significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that it folds as a origami.
There are places in the role that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> dots end up in the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots are on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what to block is complex, as a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that we did, and then create a drug that does.
Until recently, most of you have reduced wires and expected the best.
But now there are a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists to <unk> physical chemicals, and <unk>
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when you test these drugs in <unk>
These are healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick with each other inside them, like Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive result -- but the research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so that it grows that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to make sure that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we fix it, we can <unk>
In the case of other disease, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments and pharmaceutical industry, and <unk>
That was essential to progress on HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden invisible victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases of a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> that cannot create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and to help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I put this article on the New York Times column in January of this year.
To love someone, do this.
And the paper is about a <unk> study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience by trying to test it a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are <unk> to be done by doing 36 and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions here.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number one: When did the last time was the last time you get asked another person?
And <unk>
<unk> these are increasingly personal and healthier.
Number three: <unk> <unk> really <unk> your partner what you like from him or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've never met.
When I came up with this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me the attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, I was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
However, we were <unk> and  and I thought it was a good story, so I send him to the column for a few months later.
And that was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask yourself, they still follow them together.
And the reason I think you know this is because they've been asking me this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the issue.
A week before the paper was <unk>
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been invited to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But one blog blog can come to a few hundreds of views like a lot, and those were usually just about my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably have a few thousand views.
And that found a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as I gave it out, I had no idea.
And the paper was published on a Friday night, and on Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And the Sunday, I had been calling me emotion, Show and Good <unk>
In a month, the paper received over eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage confidence by writing <unk> about their own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always, they were doing the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search on the <unk> of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and very strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times was published by the New York Times that included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
I read television interviews, and they would take orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid that I was afraid of getting into the icons <unk> from the process of <unk> -- a range of which I didn't feel at all about <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked on, they wanted to know whether to actually be <unk> or so if it was able to produce love, not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt about everything, that people said the wrong question.
How do you know if you were doing it together or not, and they also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these 36 fewer questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions at this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking at foster <unk> <unk> between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
Participants felt more close to doing that, several <unk> studies, they also used <unk> protocol -- as a quick way of creating trust, and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they have used it between people in a foreign political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried the last summer, and combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, it was <unk> in this paper, but unfortunately it never got published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and he told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to tell you about the person who would be <unk>
Well he made a break.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they could get better better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's about love.
And I came up with the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really hard separation of a really difficult separation of a really difficult separation of a really difficult separation of a really difficult separation of a really difficult separation of a really difficult separation of a really difficult separation of a really difficult separation of a really difficult separation of
He had had that relationship since I had 20, which was virtually virtually all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and he had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I took to the science.
And I did all that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I hoped that it could be a certain <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I was just studying for the book that I wrote but in retrospect, it really seems to be <unk>
I thought that if I met the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel as bad as I was then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand what I after.
But I can also see what I'm looking for -- and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably you can demand me.
What I'm looking for for love is an app -- not only to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but it will be <unk> on the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if they were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate something of the risk of <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because in love it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that asks, still follow together?
And the content with an answer to a response or No.
So more than a question, <unk> that we do more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love with the things that are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they are a good beginning to have a <unk> conversation about what it means to love somebody.
So, if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known year, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, and we are still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love it's not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little next to read it now, not because it isn't true, but because at the moment, I had not considered everything that choice was.
It didn't mean how many times we would have both to make that decision, and how much time I will keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded by a <unk> to love someone as generous, kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the U.S.
But what I've done, instead is to convert my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't think of.
And what I'm going to do, and what I might possibly spend my life looking for is that myth is true.
I want the very happy thing implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is a chance of choosing somebody, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few lesbian <unk> and in a way, I came like a forest <unk>
New York City makes a while.  One thing that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and I took a dollar bill a dollar, a dollar, and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or a few aliens could find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> I like to go out of a field and make <unk> and all those things, and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style of Agnes Martin, I covered them from resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of the bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking, I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: in a way that it seemed to come up with a size, like it was that it goes through the text with a <unk>
So I did I build more boxes.
This time, I began to add some strange elements and frogs strange bottles that was finding the street, all that I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that my God, I can draw in space.
I can flow back up, draw just like a <unk> in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, you can get an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
He was great, man.
At some point I was interested in the human form, sculptures of a human size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was shocked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
So I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing in a window, then in another window, and another window, and I had all of these windows together that are a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really works, and I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work was a very big thing, that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has a little bit <unk> so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There is a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
Here's where the creatures with heads of animals are headed by <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is made of thousands of elements.
This is a god strapped on a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand gets out of it.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit of story.
So that's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> tail, which joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn into a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why I did that.
Things that go around you know.
Their tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> <unk> made of terrorist cards in 1986.
They have <unk> them.
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards in the terrorists.
Pretty <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> and <unk>
But each one acts as a kind of archive in the form of being human, and they travel in 20, four or 12 at a time.
They are like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm taking years.
Each one is basically a microscope of microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> the chest can be <unk>
I'm going to get to you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and that it covers the penis or a <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of thing <unk>
It's a quick refresher of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There's a few pills coming out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a writer, a <unk> radio, a museum, and a publishing arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
It takes the box and all of the people in the verge of each other as particles.
And I think that's how we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, in the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill. It has effect against pain, first happens by the stomach, the guts and other organs.
So I'm going to take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug is going to be able to be able to do in the body.
The <unk> however, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take drugs that are <unk> these serve as the number of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of cells.
But they are also known for their <unk> side effects in its most negative, because in time that you take to the current stream is <unk> and worse than the time you get to their destination, which is where it's most important in the HIV facility.
These are regions of the body like the lymph <unk> the <unk> the nervous system, the <unk> where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cell cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is an treatment of life run by the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, "We will make the treatment directly into the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me: the <unk> of course.
If you used to be used in <unk> for the wounds of wounds and surgery of diabetes, you can be used for anything <unk> including <unk> percent of drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes that open up and close to almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little laser beam laser on the cellular cell living with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drugs.
The laser run through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of years.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to take this technology to the human body, apply to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, We'll do a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera is going to be the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the eradication of the HIV of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all <unk> researcher in our case, a laser.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I have studied armed groups that are not <unk> the armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shoot <unk>
My goal is to understand better than these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to the violent nonviolent confrontation in the violent nonviolent confrontation in the violent nonviolent confrontation in the violent nonviolent confrontation in the violent nonviolent confrontation in the violent nonviolent confrontation in the violent nonviolent confrontation in the violent nonviolent confrontation in the violent nonviolent confrontation in the violent nonviolent
I do work in the field of the politics and in the library.
Understanding groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-governmental actors.
For example, the <unk> peace arrangements in 1975, and 2011, <unk> was signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any resolution of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
So we know very well the reasons why they are doing it, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't get <unk>
The armed struggle and policy policy is not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military system.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide attacks against their suicide attacks in Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
They're multitasking
We had a complex machine, of communication stations, radio stations television channels and Internet websites and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the journal <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
Political groups also invest in a complex fundraising fundraising fundraising <unk> but by doing business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are <unk>
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit and build their brand.
Political groups also make something else: they create stronger ties with their population to invest in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals, put in professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn down the war or even the beginning of <unk> <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a broad price for the population.
But in general, provide social services means to fill a <unk> a <unk> gap by government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 of the Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill up <unk> gaps by government, and rise as armed and politicians, participate in the violent struggle and provide governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated the very sophisticated organizations are these different organizations, we can actually engage them as something as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory, and they run all of their functions, collect the trash, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is it <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without a state and hybrids and the better the states are states, as in the Middle East, more in the Middle East, and they fill that gap and fill that gap.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in no military tools.
<unk> that government governance has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put peace.
If we understand better groups -- we might better get better what incentive to be offered to foster the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors <unk> the military power can win some <unk> but we don't give us peace and stability.
In order to get these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safe vacuum of security, to fill that governance vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My views on gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the <unk> tag would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And so I would love it as a <unk>
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in the interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women, <unk> <unk> with the men and that <unk> sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> who might be feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which begs too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also, I proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They were doing the same for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> free or violence.
We have right to use it very easy and accessible to the contraceptives and the <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need of checks or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There is more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and social condition, and so much more.
We need to have to account these differences and how we behave in the same way that it matters in common.
Without this type of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make a bad deal.
I've got another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music -- all volume.
Although the letter degrades to women and a <unk> the classic <unk> <unk> of Yin yang of Yin yang <unk> is incredible.
<unk> reality with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you give you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am completely <unk> by my musical self.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> work, but also killing insects, the collection of garbage -- the grass <unk> and the maintenance maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from the fashion magazines and the nice stuff.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic <unk> from the <unk> stories that make reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not a person who is <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, I had to be that choice as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this decision, the problem is that our society is <unk> so what makes women be economically vulnerable when they were <unk>
So let's take this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically historically the needs of women of color, and <unk> gay and <unk> for white, <unk> and high school.
Listen, if that's good feminism I am a very bad feminist box.
It also happens the following: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
Do we have this trend of <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope it would be true for perfection.
When we get rid of them with a lot of <unk> from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself to be <unk> before you try to get me there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a <unk> fear of what it means that <unk> for fear cannot be able to accomplish with little realistic expectations.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it. The <unk>
In the last few years is a <unk> feminist feminist here.
In the <unk> Music County <unk> in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> for three meters tall.
It was a <unk> show to see this star from the poo embracing openly feminism and to know women and young men who would be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started the endless debates if <unk> was or no feminist <unk>
<unk> its feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of the <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much.
We're going to go much beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism from any woman, <unk> until it won't be anything.
We don't need to do that.
The bad bet, or more well, one more feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to the day, will happen to the action and be a little <unk>
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be happier to be happier to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change effectively to make a profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does the music that be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad decisions justify this makes it harder for women to get equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
It's two girls and <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
It's where they were telling them for strong creatures that are.
And I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice is <unk> as a much easier thing to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women like sports, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio radio when we heard songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when films are not about women as much as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, participating in your project, or working with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but they will engage in this kind of projects, we can also empower them to be even more like us to be able to make the barriers to <unk>
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will get to the top, people in the power and the movie producers and movie and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create lasting and significant change.
We can also tell the courage to our achievement, good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to be <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you about everything, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to address what happened.
A couple of kids came up with me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe it was nothing.
It <unk> my voice, and after I didn't believe me that I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And so I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing and feminism, too, I discovered that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the fact that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to get anything.
And in the other, I have a <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good researcher, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope we can all be a little courageous, when you need to be a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> because of being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be fatal for a child with a immune immune system is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that broke the argument on autism and vaccines <unk> and made it by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Medical
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that cause vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of the autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians have heard that I had heard of her a professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, estimates of prevalence went stable only three or four children for every <unk>
But then, in the 1990s the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> dollars as a <unk> <unk> they refer to autism as an epidemic as an epidemic, as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Disease Center, what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young woman who searches in the face of their son of two years, visual contact with.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why were they so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to find the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> from science that with the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism than had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital -- in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 patients who looked at 11 young patients who seemed to be <unk> and private worlds -- to the people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by waving their hands before they were waving their faces, but they were convicted of panic for <unk> as when they were not putting their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
For the 1950s, the main authority of the world in the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as far as South Africa references as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, I will give that diagnosis of children with seizures -- but now we know that epilepsy, is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had become nine of every 10 children sent by their office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child sexually caused by cold, cold and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have kept it carefully on a refrigerator <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of her young patients had special abilities that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could tell between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, stating things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents were desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970, the researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, I thought the theory of mothers who were <unk> was quite stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like no support, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the U.S. National Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, <unk> and his colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years earlier.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find autistic kids in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse it.
Some children couldn't talk at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination for astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
In other ways, these children didn't fit little <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody ever realize these children before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the <unk> item and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article from competition, but I avoided <unk> in his own work.
There was no even an English translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> speak German, and he <unk> him for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a integrated clinical clinic in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic, they started with music classes with music, and kids kept their games at the evening.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism as a child described described as a disabled disability, of life that required forms of support and spaces adapted for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, as a patients, I called them their little teachers, and he started to help in the development methods that were especially appropriate for them.
And there was a little bit of autism as a diverse continuous continuum that serves an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> <unk> in the pop culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to even the success of science and art, a bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong with autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked silently with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> by the limited model of <unk> by a broad and inclusive model.
These changes didn't go into broken <unk>
<unk> when I <unk> and Judith working between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see a autistic adult for the first time.
Before he came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents knew what the autism.
At the same time, they were introduced early clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a perfect <unk> of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses began to <unk> as they predicted <unk> and <unk> of fact they were expecting to be out of the way that it was, what it was, getting people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines by the rise in the diagnostics. A simple, powerful, <unk> story that the autism theory was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, is right, the autistic are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
Over the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles to solve the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
A way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> social <unk> and suffers from a deficit deficit on the details.
Indeed, autistic people, they have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that he believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism is in understanding the teachers, employers with capacity, communities support, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
One autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As you move towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
